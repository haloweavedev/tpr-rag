Compared to much of what I read this year, this novel has incredible world building and indelible characters. But still, <strong>The Rose Field</strong> is a disappointment.</p>\n<p>If you’ve not read the five books that precede this one, don’t bother. It’s densely referential and even I, who’ve read the earlier books more than once, struggled to remember characters and plot points.

There, she believes, is a window into a world with roses that are necessary to enable Dust. Pan believes that the building will have something in it that will help Lyra find again her imagination which he is certain she has lost. Also trying to get there is Malcolm Polstead, a scholar who, in book two, seemed to be a love interest for Lyra.

Worse—so much worse—is that in this book the power of the first trilogy is startlingly diminished. The rules that were so brilliantly established in <em>His Dark Materials</em>, rules that forced Will and Lyra to live in separate worlds, are now framed as fungible, possibly misrepresented.

We dress the tree, hanging with care the delicate glass ornaments gifted to us over the many years, sentimentally rub our fingers over the ones our children made, pull out the stepladder and put our angel to balance precariously on the top branch. We play endless Spotify holiday playlists (<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3T2Af03GrEiXYTweMYqKyv?si=DX_Enm2JTmKF9JC_NIxyGA\">here&#8217;s my favorite</a>) and watch <em>Love, Actually</em> and <em>Elf</em> for the millionth time. And we bring out our beloved holiday books. We giggle over <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2PSLFqu\"><strong>Morris&#8217; Disappearing Bag</strong></a>, admire the wit of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2PSLFqu\"><strong>Auntie Claus</strong></a>, and wipe away the tears as we marvel over <strong>The Christmas Miracle Of Jonathan Toomey</strong>.</p>\n<p>Published first in 1995, Susan Wojciechowski&#8217;s profoundly moving tale is many things. It&#8217;s a meditation on grief, a testament to learning to live after soul-crushing loss, a paean to power of selfless love, and celebration of the Christ&#8217;s story. Not only is the prose pitch perfect but the illustrations are <a href=\"http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/caldecottmedal/caldecottmedal\">Caldecott</a> worthy. (If your family listens to audiobooks, <a href=\"https://www.candlewick.com/Toomey/\">the narration by James Earl Jones</a> is sublime and, oh happy day, free for all to hear.)</p>\n<p>The book introduces us to Jonathan Toomey, a woodcarver in a small town in colonial America. He keeps to himself and the townspeople, who call him Mr. Gloomy, see him as a curmudgeon who complains when the birds sing and the children play.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The village people didn’t know it, but there was a reason for his gloom, a reason for his grumbling, a reason why he walked hunched over, as if carrying a great weight on his shoulders. Some years earlier, when Jonathan Toomey was young and full of life and full of love, his wife and baby had become very ill. And, because those were the days before hospitals and medicines and skilled doctors, his wife and baby had died, three days apart from each other. So Jonathan Toomey had packed his belongings into a wagon and travelled till his tears stopped. He settled into a tiny house at the edge of a village to do his wood-carving.</p></blockquote>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-92641 alignleft\" src=\"https://allaboutromance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/jonathantoomey2cthomasandthewidowlores-300x201.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"201\" srcset=\"https://allaboutromance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/jonathantoomey2cthomasandthewidowlores-300x201.jpg 300w, https://allaboutromance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/jonathantoomey2cthomasandthewidowlores-150x100.jpg 150w, https://allaboutromance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/jonathantoomey2cthomasandthewidowlores-200x134.jpg 200w, https://allaboutromance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/jonathantoomey2cthomasandthewidowlores-400x268.jpg 400w, https://allaboutromance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/jonathantoomey2cthomasandthewidowlores-600x402.jpg 600w, https://allaboutromance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/jonathantoomey2cthomasandthewidowlores.jpg 765w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" />One day, in early December, there&#8217;s a knock on his door.

                "text": "(originally published on December 25, 2019) Despite being a family of non-believers, every year we pull out our holiday paraphernalia. We dress the tree, hanging with care the delicate glass ornaments gifted to us over the many years, sentimentally rub our fingers over the ones our children made, pull out the stepladder and put our angel to balance precariously on the top branch. We play endless Spotify holiday playlists (here&#8217;s my favorite) and watch Love, Actually and Elf for the millionth time. And we bring out our beloved holiday books. We giggle over Morris&#8217; Disappearing Bag, admire the wit of Auntie Claus, and wipe away the tears as we marvel over The Christmas Miracle Of Jonathan Toomey. Published first in 1995, Susan Wojciechowski&#8217;s profoundly moving tale is many things. It&#8217;s a meditation on grief, a testament to learning to live after soul-crushing loss, a paean to power of selfless love, and celebration of the Christ&#8217;s story. Not only is the prose pitch perfect but the illustrations are Caldecott worthy. (If your family listens to audiobooks, the narration by James Earl Jones is sublime and, oh happy day, free for all to hear.) The book introduces us to Jonathan Toomey, a woodcarver in a small town in colonial America. He keeps to himself and the townspeople, who call him Mr. Gloomy, see him as a curmudgeon who complains when the birds sing and the children play. The village people didn’t know it, but there was a reason for his gloom, a reason for his grumbling, a reason why he walked hunched over, as if carrying a great weight on his shoulders. Some years earlier, when Jonathan Toomey was young and full of life and full of love, his wife and baby had become very ill. And, because those were the days before hospitals and medicines and skilled doctors, his wife and baby had died, three days apart from each other. So Jonathan Toomey had packed his belongings into a wagon and travelled till his tears stopped. He settled into a tiny house at the edge of a village to do his wood-carving. One day, in early December, there&#8217;s a knock on his door. It&#8217;s the Widow McDowell and her seven year old son Thomas. They&#8217;re new to the village and have heard that Jonathan is the best wood carver in the area. In their move, they lost a much loved Nativity set and they&#8217;d like him to remake it. Despite asserting that there are no miracles and that Christmas is pish-posh, he agrees to do the work. A week later, the widow and Thomas come to check on Jonathan&#8217;s progress&#8211;Thomas wants to be a woodcarver and he sits by Jonathan&#8217;s side as his mother knits. They are at first silent but then, Thomas whispered, “Mr Toomey, excuse me, but you’re carving my sheep wrong.” The widow McDowell’s knitting-needles stopped clicking. Jonathan Toomey’s knife stopped carving. Thomas went on. “It’s a beautiful sheep, nice and curly, but my sheep looked happy.” “That’s pish-posh,” said Mr Toomey. “Sheep are sheep. They cannot look happy.” “Mine did,” said Thomas. “They knew they were with the Baby Jesus, so they were happy.” I won&#8217;t spoil the rest of the story except to say that the tale of this Christmas miracle is one that never&#8211;never&#8211;fails to fill me with joy.

So when James Sutton appears in her office, she naturally assumes the agency has sent her a holiday upgrade.

He’s her family’s chief business competitor and the proximity might give him an edge. Besides, the moment they see each other, the sparks are undeniable.</p>\n<p>I liked Cassie and James. She wants more than the narrow path her father imagines for her, though she hasn’t yet figured out how to seize it. James is an alpha who’s used to being in charge, but Cassie refuses to play along, and he finds that both maddening and appealing. It’s clear they suit each other and it&#8217;s good fun to watch them slowly figure that out.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Lane surrounds them with an amusing supporting cast. Cassie’s boisterous brothers argue as if it were a competitive sport, her aunt meddles with abandon, and the neighbors behave as though the McPhersons’ business were their own. There’s even a sweet secondary romance for her brother Rory. (I’m a sucker for a good secondary romance, and this one is a winner.)</p>\n<p>The premise requires some suspension of disbelief—surely someone in this family has looked up their chief competitor—but the novel’s charm makes that easy to ignore. Cassie is genuinely likable, James’s alpha edge works for the story, and the whole thing moves with enough spark and momentum to keep you engaged. <strong>Hunk for the Holidays</strong> is funny, sexy, and satisfying—exactly the sort of romance that can make December reading feel like a treat.</p>\n",

Our heroine, Cassie McPherson, worn down by her family’s matchmaking, has hired escorts before—just someone to stand beside her at yet another McPherson gathering. So when James Sutton appears in her office, she naturally assumes the agency has sent her a holiday upgrade. James, who arrived expecting a business meeting with her father, steps into the role with deceptive ease. Why not try it? He’s her family’s chief business competitor and the proximity might give him an edge. Besides, the moment they see each other, the sparks are undeniable. I liked Cassie and James. She wants more than the narrow path her father imagines for her, though she hasn’t yet figured out how to seize it. James is an alpha who’s used to being in charge, but Cassie refuses to play along, and he finds that both maddening and appealing. It’s clear they suit each other and it&#8217;s good fun to watch them slowly figure that out.&nbsp; Lane surrounds them with an amusing supporting cast. Cassie’s boisterous brothers argue as if it were a competitive sport, her aunt meddles with abandon, and the neighbors behave as though the McPhersons’ business were their own. There’s even a sweet secondary romance for her brother Rory. (I’m a sucker for a good secondary romance, and this one is a winner.) The premise requires some suspension of disbelief—surely someone in this family has looked up their chief competitor—but the novel’s charm makes that easy to ignore. Cassie is genuinely likable, James’s alpha edge works for the story, and the whole thing moves with enough spark and momentum to keep you engaged. Hunk for the Holidays is funny, sexy, and satisfying—exactly the sort of romance that can make December reading feel like a treat."

                "html": "<p>I met my husband, a surgeon, in the last year of his final <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12263086/\">residency</a>, and for the next fifteen years watched him train residents of his own. I have never, until <strong>Love Sick</strong>, read a romance that captures that world with such accuracy. As anyone who’s gone through it—or lived with someone who has—knows, residency isn’t just hard; it’s a ritual of endurance, a brutal process that shapes doctors to withstand the worst and still show up. You have to be almost superhuman, able to heal on a dime, and composed under pressure that would flatten most of us. It&#8217;s a world of bullying <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attending_physician\">attendings</a>, harassing administrators, irritated <a href=\"https://www.acponline.org/about-acp/about-internal-medicine/general-internal-medicine/hospital-medicine\">hospitalists</a>, and constant crises. (For better and worse, the system mostly works.) Duncan writes it <em>exactly</em> as it is. This, peeps, is contemporary romance world-building at its very best.</p>\n<p>Dr. Grace Rose, newly minted (and brilliant) OB-GYN resident, walks into this pressure cooker and discovers, to her horror, she&#8217;s already been <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hester_Prynne\">Prynned</a>.

                "text": "I met my husband, a surgeon, in the last year of his final residency, and for the next fifteen years watched him train residents of his own. I have never, until Love Sick, read a romance that captures that world with such accuracy. As anyone who’s gone through it—or lived with someone who has—knows, residency isn’t just hard; it’s a ritual of endurance, a brutal process that shapes doctors to withstand the worst and still show up. You have to be almost superhuman, able to heal on a dime, and composed under pressure that would flatten most of us. It&#8217;s a world of bullying attendings, harassing administrators, irritated hospitalists, and constant crises. (For better and worse, the system mostly works.) Duncan writes it exactly as it is. This, peeps, is contemporary romance world-building at its very best. Dr. Grace Rose, newly minted (and brilliant) OB-GYN resident, walks into this pressure cooker and discovers, to her horror, she&#8217;s already been Prynned. Before she’s even unpacked, a rumor spreads that she slept her way into the program. This story is invisible and everywhere. What begins as one malicious lie (its origin, revealed near the end, is both dismaying and believable) metastasizes into legend: Grace is a seductress, an opportunist, and, endlessly, a slut.

Two teenage girls vanish during a Fourth of July celebration in North Falls, Georgia—a town that prides itself on familiarity and tradition. Officer Emmy Clifton is devastated. One of the girls is the stepdaughter of her closest friend, and Emmy is determined to find them before it’s too late.</p>\n<p>Emmy is early in her career, working alongside her beloved father, the town’s sheriff. She is also a mother, a sister, a wife in a marriage that is quietly unraveling, and a member of the Clifton family—a long-established clan whose roots in North Falls run deep. Her marriage may be faltering, but her life is full of responsibility and connection. She is shaped by loyalty, instinct, and a steady commitment to doing what’s right. She is not hardened or brittle. She is present, capable, and fully embedded in the world around her. I liked her tremendously.</p>\n<p>Slaughter has long excelled at writing strong willed women who, no matter what is thrown their way, survive, even thrive. Emmy is one of her best. In her work life, she&#8217;s committed to using the power of the law to help others. In her personal life, she&#8217;s a gift to those she loves. Slaughter makes her relatable and real&#8211;in fact, all of the characters are vividly limned.</p>\n<p>Her parents, George and Myrna, age over the course of the novel in ways that will be immediately recognizable to anyone watching loved ones grow older. Her son Cole, in his twenties, is a standout. He&#8217;s such a 20 something and yet, like his mom, is observant, decent, and emotionally steady in a way that matters. Emmy’s friendship with Hannah, her closest confidante, and her relationship with her sister-in-law Celia are equally vivid. These women comfort, challenge, and support each other with a mix of candor and care that feels earned. The Cliftons, as a family, struggle to talk openly about their emotions. They are strong, often quiet, unfailingly loyal, and surprisingly funny. They love without flourish. That limitation becomes a strength. Emmy is not idealized, but she is the kind of person you want nearby when things fall apart.</p>\n<p>The Clifton family, in fact, is every bit as compelling as the villains and the havoc they create. Slaughter gives them the kind of layered attention most thrillers reserve for the perpetrators. Their affection is messy and enduring. Their friction feels lived-in. They linger because they are drawn with clarity and warmth.</p>\n<p>The novel unfolds in three parts. The first reads like classic Slaughter: girls go missing, predators hide in plain sight, and a town’s surface calm begins to crack. It is grim in places and occasionally familiar. Then the narrative leaps forward twelve years, and the book opens up. Assumptions fracture. Histories shift. One late reveal genuinely startled me—not for its shock value, but because of how fully it reframed what had come before.</p>\n<p>The final section, an extended epilogue, is the most affecting. With the case resolved, Slaughter gives her characters time to breathe. After so much violence, the tenderness of these closing chapters is striking. People reach for each other. They find language, however limited, for what they feel. There is grief, but also connection. Slaughter allows love to emerge not as a reward, but as a consequence of survival. I cried.</p>\n<p>Jude, the FBI consultant who arrives in the second half, is unforgettable. She is astute, composed, and uninterested in performance. She does not draw attention, but her presence recalibrates every scene she enters. Her competence, insight, and dry humor offer something rare in fiction: a woman entirely unbothered by expectation. More characters like her would be a gift.</p>\n<p>This is the first in a series, and that direction feels right. Not every thread is resolved, and several characters—Jude, Dylan, Cole, Millie—are clearly positioned for more to come.

After reading Charlotte McConaghy&#8217;s phenomenal <strong>Wild Dark Shore</strong>, it seems to me that hope is a seed. I confess that, prior to reading Wild Dark Shore, I&#8217;d not really thought much about seeds. I&#8217;m not much of a gardener and the plants I do nurture I buy once they&#8217;re, well, plants. But, as Orly, one of the narrators of this climate change novel tells us, again and again, seeds are miraculous—not just fragile signs of life, but brilliant survivors. Here, he&#8217;s describing how the seeds of the banksia, a wildflower native to Australia, responded to deadly wildfires:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Only to black ground, only to ash, will the banksia give its seed. And only within this scorched wasteland can it survive and find a way to thrive. From beneath the carpet of ash—which the untrained eye would look at and see death—comes life, bursting free.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Orly is the youngest son of Dominic Salt, a widower raising his three children on a remote island south of New Zealand. The island, Shearwater, is, like much of the world, sinking—literally—and as the seas claim the island, Dominic and his family are packing up seeds chosen from the millions stored there—Shearwater&#8217;s seed bank is loosely based on the Svalbard Global Seed Bank. They are the last ones left on the island—all the scientists have left—and in a few weeks a ship will come and take the Salt family and the seeds elsewhere. Or they were the last ones on the island until a woman, nearly dead, washes up on their shore.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Her name is Rowan. Now, no one comes to Shearwater unless they mean to—unless they have a purpose. Dominic doesn’t believe in coincidence. He knows she&#8217;s keeping secrets. She, though, is not the only one. Something happened in the final days of the island’s research station. What, we don&#8217;t know. And as the narrative shifts between perspectives—Dominic’s, Rowan’s, and Dominic&#8217;s three kids, Raff, Fen, and Orly—an extraordinary story unfolds.</p>\n<p>The book does many things, all well. It&#8217;s a thrilling read—Rowan&#8217;s secret is connected to those of the Salts and the emotional tension is almost claustrophobically intense. It&#8217;s a novel about the glories of nature—the island teems with seals, birds, penguins, and more, and all are portrayed with precision and wonder. It&#8217;s an apocalyptic climate change story, and the descriptions of wildfires, floods, and raging seas are terrifying and seemingly prophetic. But, most of all, it&#8217;s a story about love, friendship, and families found and made.</p>\n<p>I finished this book days ago and it’s still with me. <strong>Wild Dark Shore</strong> demands you sit with devastation and still believe in something salvageable.

                "html": "<p data-start=\"508\" data-end=\"673\">I love this book. It’s sexy, very funny, moving, grounded in its sense of place, and just—well—yummy. It’s easily the best contemporary romance I’ve read this year.</p>\n<p data-start=\"675\" data-end=\"1062\">Callum Macabe met Juniper Ross on a train from Edinburgh to Glasgow and fell for her before he realized who she was: his younger brother Alistair’s girlfriend. Two years later, after her adopted father died and her engagement ended, they crossed paths again in Glasgow. They nearly slept together. Callum pulled away, convinced she would never see him as more than the consolation prize.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1064\" data-end=\"1100\">Another year passed. Then five more.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1102\" data-end=\"1674\">Now Callum is back on the Isle of Skye—temporarily, or so he keeps telling himself. He’s the village vet, the man who can stitch up a sheep before breakfast and still remember your dog’s name. But he’s really come home to help his mother care for his father, whose Alzheimer’s is worsening by the day. He hasn’t told his brothers or sister how hard it’s gotten. He doesn’t want to bother them. That silence isn’t noble; it’s isolating. And the longer he stays, the harder it becomes to pretend he doesn’t want more—from the town, from his family, and especially from June.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1676\" data-end=\"2328\">June, now thirty, helps run the Ivy House Inn and avoids Callum with a precision that suggests practice. They fight whenever they speak—sharp, absurd, often hilarious arguments that have become their signature. Everyone in the village sees the chemistry. They refuse to admit it. June grew up in foster care and learned early not to count on anyone. Even now, with a loving adoptive mother and neighbors who clearly care, she keeps herself apart. The drumbeat in her head says she’ll always be the one left behind. The book never reduces that to backstory. It’s baked into her instincts, her pride, her refusal to ask for help—even when she’s drowning.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2330\" data-end=\"2812\">When her mother leaves on a singles’ cruise, June finally starts the renovations she’s long wanted—but nothing goes smoothly. The inn springs leaks, the bills spiral, and June tries to handle it alone. Callum offers help in exchange for something that looks like companionship but smells a lot like courtship: trips around Skye so she can better recommend the island to guests. She agrees. Not because she wants his company. Because she already has it, whether she admits it or not.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2814\" data-end=\"3261\">This isn’t a “grumpy/sunshine” pairing. June isn’t grumpy. She’s cautious, private, and deeply self-reliant. Callum isn’t sunshine. He’s charming, yes, but it’s a charm built to keep people from looking too closely. She’s exhausted by pretending she doesn’t care. He’s exhausted by pretending he doesn’t need anything. What makes them work isn’t contrast—it’s recognition. They know what the other is hiding because they’re hiding the same things.</p>\n<p data-start=\"3263\" data-end=\"3715\">When June and Callum finally touch, it’s not tender. It’s reckless and hungry and long overdue. They don’t ease into it—they lunge, all sharp edges and pent-up wanting.

                "text": "I love this book. It’s sexy, very funny, moving, grounded in its sense of place, and just—well—yummy. It’s easily the best contemporary romance I’ve read this year. Callum Macabe met Juniper Ross on a train from Edinburgh to Glasgow and fell for her before he realized who she was: his younger brother Alistair’s girlfriend. Two years later, after her adopted father died and her engagement ended, they crossed paths again in Glasgow. They nearly slept together. Callum pulled away, convinced she would never see him as more than the consolation prize. Another year passed. Then five more. Now Callum is back on the Isle of Skye—temporarily, or so he keeps telling himself. He’s the village vet, the man who can stitch up a sheep before breakfast and still remember your dog’s name. But he’s really come home to help his mother care for his father, whose Alzheimer’s is worsening by the day. He hasn’t told his brothers or sister how hard it’s gotten. He doesn’t want to bother them. That silence isn’t noble; it’s isolating. And the longer he stays, the harder it becomes to pretend he doesn’t want more—from the town, from his family, and especially from June. June, now thirty, helps run the Ivy House Inn and avoids Callum with a precision that suggests practice. They fight whenever they speak—sharp, absurd, often hilarious arguments that have become their signature. Everyone in the village sees the chemistry. They refuse to admit it. June grew up in foster care and learned early not to count on anyone. Even now, with a loving adoptive mother and neighbors who clearly care, she keeps herself apart. The drumbeat in her head says she’ll always be the one left behind. The book never reduces that to backstory. It’s baked into her instincts, her pride, her refusal to ask for help—even when she’s drowning. When her mother leaves on a singles’ cruise, June finally starts the renovations she’s long wanted—but nothing goes smoothly. The inn springs leaks, the bills spiral, and June tries to handle it alone. Callum offers help in exchange for something that looks like companionship but smells a lot like courtship: trips around Skye so she can better recommend the island to guests. She agrees. Not because she wants his company. Because she already has it, whether she admits it or not. This isn’t a “grumpy/sunshine” pairing. June isn’t grumpy. She’s cautious, private, and deeply self-reliant. Callum isn’t sunshine. He’s charming, yes, but it’s a charm built to keep people from looking too closely. She’s exhausted by pretending she doesn’t care. He’s exhausted by pretending he doesn’t need anything. What makes them work isn’t contrast—it’s recognition. They know what the other is hiding because they’re hiding the same things. When June and Callum finally touch, it’s not tender. It’s reckless and hungry and long overdue. They don’t ease into it—they lunge, all sharp edges and pent-up wanting. It’s not clean or careful, but it’s exactly right for who they are and how long they’ve tried to pretend it wasn’t going to happen. The sex is intense, but what makes it unforgettable is what’s underneath: years of resentment, longing, and the terrifying relief of finally giving in. Callum’s family—especially his father’s decline—is handled with restraint and precision. His refusal to ask for help is maddening, but entirely in character. When his siblings finally find out how bad things have gotten, they’re furious. Not because they’re hurt, but because they were never given the chance to step in.

The sense of place is real. It never tries to sell you on a postcard version of Scotland. It lets you believe these people live here. You understand why they stay. June has a rulebook. She wrote it after her heart got broken: Don’t look at a Macabe brother. Don’t talk to a Macabe brother. Don’t even think about a Macabe brother. She breaks all three.And thank God she does."

Her father, once a high-flying finance mogul, is in prison for defrauding clients out of hundreds of millions. Her brother is dead, and many believe she’s to blame.

Then another man sits down at the table next to hers, and this one is impossible to ignore. She bails on her date and goes home, unsettled. The stranger is gorgeous but clearly dangerous to the careful anonymity she’s built. A few nights later, under suspicious circumstances, she nearly runs him over.

Each chapter raises the stakes, and Keyes handles the escalation with precision and restraint.</p>\n<p>What makes the novel so absorbing isn’t just the pacing—it’s the relationship at its center.

Could <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l5sj07Ggpk\">Claire</a> really have bounced through the centuries? Wouldn’t shifters face endless wardrobe malfunctions? And surely someone would have noticed all those carts disappearing into <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiwaD-Jdb3I\">Platform 9¾</a>.</p>\n<p>When fiction is done well, those leaps are effortless. You know it’s improbable, but in the hands of a skilled author, the world and characters feel solid enough to hold your belief. The unlikely becomes, for the length of the story, entirely plausible.</p>\n<p>Then there are the &#8220;NFW&#8221; books—No F**king Way novels. These stories ask readers to accept scenarios so absurd that the world they present collapses under scrutiny. Lisa Jewell&#8217;s <strong>Don&#8217;t Let Him In</strong> is a spectacular example of this. Set in modern times, the plot hinges on a premise so implausible—particularly in an age of smartphones, CCTV, and stringent banking regulations—that it’s impossible to take seriously. That said, it&#8217;s also a wild, entertaining ride.</p>\n<p>The story centers on Nick Radcliffe, a preternaturally charming man who manipulates women with an almost superhuman talent. As the novel begins, Nick&#8217;s in his late mid 50s and is determinedly working his way into the heart and home of Nina Swann, the widow of successful restauranteur Paddy Swann. A year ago, Paddy was pushed onto train tracks by a mentally ill young man. Now his wife and his daughter Ash are trying to get on with their lives&#8211;Nina is running her husband&#8217;s dining empire and Ash is trying to get her life back on track after a mental breakdown. One day, a year after Paddy&#8217;s death, Nick Radcliffe contacts Nina. He sends her a lighter he says belonged, years ago, to Paddy with whom he briefly worked. One thing leads to another and soon Nick is in the Swann home, charming Nina and making Ash very suspicious of his motives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An hour or so up the coast (the book is set in England), there&#8217;s another woman whose story we learn. Martha is an ambitious and talented florist whose husband Al routinely goes missing. He says it&#8217;s for work but Martha is beginning to wonder what on earth is really going on.

                "text": "Every reader has encountered books that require a leap of faith. Could Claire really have bounced through the centuries? Wouldn’t shifters face endless wardrobe malfunctions? And surely someone would have noticed all those carts disappearing into Platform 9¾. When fiction is done well, those leaps are effortless. You know it’s improbable, but in the hands of a skilled author, the world and characters feel solid enough to hold your belief. The unlikely becomes, for the length of the story, entirely plausible. Then there are the &#8220;NFW&#8221; books—No F**king Way novels. These stories ask readers to accept scenarios so absurd that the world they present collapses under scrutiny. Lisa Jewell&#8217;s Don&#8217;t Let Him In is a spectacular example of this. Set in modern times, the plot hinges on a premise so implausible—particularly in an age of smartphones, CCTV, and stringent banking regulations—that it’s impossible to take seriously. That said, it&#8217;s also a wild, entertaining ride. The story centers on Nick Radcliffe, a preternaturally charming man who manipulates women with an almost superhuman talent. As the novel begins, Nick&#8217;s in his late mid 50s and is determinedly working his way into the heart and home of Nina Swann, the widow of successful restauranteur Paddy Swann. A year ago, Paddy was pushed onto train tracks by a mentally ill young man. Now his wife and his daughter Ash are trying to get on with their lives&#8211;Nina is running her husband&#8217;s dining empire and Ash is trying to get her life back on track after a mental breakdown. One day, a year after Paddy&#8217;s death, Nick Radcliffe contacts Nina. He sends her a lighter he says belonged, years ago, to Paddy with whom he briefly worked. One thing leads to another and soon Nick is in the Swann home, charming Nina and making Ash very suspicious of his motives.&nbsp;&nbsp; An hour or so up the coast (the book is set in England), there&#8217;s another woman whose story we learn. Martha is an ambitious and talented florist whose husband Al routinely goes missing. He says it&#8217;s for work but Martha is beginning to wonder what on earth is really going on. He disappears for days at a time, not answering calls or texts, and though he always has some densely worded reasonable sounding excuse, increasingly Martha struggles to believe him.&nbsp; Jewell&#8217;s narration offers us alternating points of view&#8211;Ash&#8217;s, Nick&#8217;s, Al&#8217;s, and Martha&#8217;s&#8211;goes back and forth in time. a possilbe spoilerIt&#8217;s very clear to the reader that Al is Nick&#8211;this book&#8217;s suspense lies in the how of Nick/Al&#8217;s actions.

                "html": "<blockquote><p>JANUARY 1942. THE AVALLON HOTEL AND SPA offers elegance and sophistication in an increasingly ugly world. Run with precision by June Hudson, the hotel’s West Virginia born-and-bred general manager, the Avallon is where high society goes to see and be seen, and where the mountain sweetwater in the fountains and spas can wash away all your troubles.</p>\n<p>June was trained by the Gilfoyles, the hotel’s aristocratic owners, and she has guided the Avallon skillfully through the first pangs of war. Now, though, the Gilfoyle family heir has made a secret deal with the State Department to fill the hotel with captured Axis diplomats. June must convince her staff—many of whom have sons and husbands heading to the frontlines—to offer luxury to Nazis. With a smile.</p>\n<p>She also must reckon with Tucker Minnick, the FBI agent whose coal tattoo hints at their shared past in the mountains, and whose search for the diplomats’ secrets disrupts the peace June is fighting so hard to maintain. Hers is a balancing act with dangerous consequences; the sweetwater beneath the hotel can threaten as well as heal, and only June can manage the springs.</p>\n<p>As dark alliances and an elusive spy crack the polished veneer of the Avallon, June must calculate the true cost of luxury.</p>\n<p>________________________________________________________________</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: Over the past couple of years, I’ve become far more interested in historical fiction than I used to be. Perhaps it’s because I’ve found more books with female leads or maybe it’s because I’ve encountered reads that are NOT dual time-line, a fictional affectation I don’t love. For whatever reason, my favorite books of the past few years have been historical fiction–The <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/the-frozen-river-by-ariel-lawhon/\"><strong>Frozen River</strong></a> in 2023 and <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/eleanor-of-avignon-by-elizabeth-delozier/\"><strong>Eleanore of Avignon</strong></a> in 2024. <strong>The Listeners</strong> is already on my list of top books for 2025. For me, it was the perfect blend of storytelling, real history, compelling characters, and a nuanced view of the past.</p>\n<p>What did you think of it?</p>\n<p><strong>Maggie</strong>: <strong>Frozen River</strong> is a terrific book. I would attribute all the characteristics you listed for <strong>The Listeners</strong> -the perfect blend of storytelling, real history, compelling characters, and a nuanced view of the past- as strengths of that novel. Most of my reading in recent years has been comprised of historicals set in the early to mid-20th century. I find I’ve grown particular about these stories since we both have such a plethora of information about the era that all the novels should easily capture the history of it, and because so many excellent writers are working within that milieu. This novel had a lot to live up to and I didn’t feel it quite hit the bar.</p>\n<p>With <strong>The Listeners</strong>, the story felt almost isolated, like everything was happening in a moment detached from the rest of reality, in an area so remote the everyday world didn’t intrude upon it. The magical surrealistic element of the sweetwater and June’s strange connection to it added to that sense of irreality and pulled it even further from the history of the period. How did you feel about that element of the tale?</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: I think that’s what I liked best about it! There are so so so many WWII books and, to me, they rarely show me anything new. This one, with its focus on this world apart, riveted me. The narrowness of its scope allowed me to really think about the characters, their motivations and responses to their circumstances. The larger world hovers outside the story and we know how it goes but, in the pages of the Listeners, individuals are revealed in their distinct complexity.</p>\n<p><strong>Maggie</strong>: Interesting! I didn’t find any of them particularly nuanced. The bad guys were bad and the good guys good, who instinctively knew right from wrong. Did you feel there was ever a possibility that the characters who were presented as morally questionable would turn out to be the heroes and vice versa? Which characters did you feel represented that?</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: This is one of these conversations where I feel as if we read different books! I thought almost all the characters were nuanced. Even the leads, and especially June, make choices that were sort of iffy in some ways. And the guests, the Japanese and Germans, were fascinating to me. I was especially riveted by the story of the Wolfes, the German family whose loyalties were strained because of their daughter.</p>\n<p><strong>Maggie</strong>: I didn’t feel the Wolfe&#8217;s loyalties were divided; there were lines they weren’t willing to cross even for their child. They loved her just enough to want to prevent her from dying, but I’m not sure they could even see the issue beyond her to the hundreds of other lives involved. I couldn&#8217;t help but compare it to the Smith family’s dilemma in Man in the High Castle and how they were forced to confront who they are, who they were, who they should be, and all the choices that led to their present predicament. (World at War does an interesting take on the issue as well.)</p>\n<p>There’s a strong romance here, what did you think of the love story?</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: I think one of the polarizing things about this book–which I liked–is that the Germans and the Japanese were portrayed more sympathetically than one usually sees in fiction about WWII. So, it’s true they didn’t care about the many many lives their nations were wreaking havoc on–they only cared about their own families. That was interesting to me–I’m always curious about the inner workings of the other.</p>\n<p>I liked the love story–and there are really two. I thought the point of both of the men in June’s life was to show her path to understanding what was right for her, both in her personal life and in her professional one. Her romances added heft to her story.</p>\n<p><strong>Maggie</strong>: We’ve had very different reading experiences. I can remember only a handful of books where the Germans weren’t shown as capable of caring for their own family and friends, but they are almost always portrayed as not being able to care beyond that and see the humanity in others that aren’t exactly like them. I definitely saw some of that here in how the diplomats treated those from even their allied nations, which I found surprising. I’ve always thought of diplomacy as the art of reaching past cultural barriers.</p>\n<p>Regarding the romance,I felt that the book showed one of June’s suitors in an extremely negative light. He was presented first as a coward, afraid to go to war, then a backstabber who had sacrificed the hotel and its staff to meet his own needs, a womanizer whom she accepted a gift from with a skeptical belief that it had been intended for another of his paramours and then his final proposition was so full of self-interest that it made Mr. Darcy’s original proposal seem warm, romantic and effusive in praise. What, aside from the wealth, did you think made him a good suitor for her?</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: I didn’t make myself clear. One of the suitors is not a good guy and the other is. What I liked is that the focus was on June and how interacting with those men taught her about herself, her values, and what her life’s effort at the Avallon truly meant.</p>\n<p><strong>Maggie</strong>: Ah! That makes sense. I agree that meeting Tucker and the diplomats helps her really see the world beyond the Avallon.

                "text": "JANUARY 1942. THE AVALLON HOTEL AND SPA offers elegance and sophistication in an increasingly ugly world. Run with precision by June Hudson, the hotel’s West Virginia born-and-bred general manager, the Avallon is where high society goes to see and be seen, and where the mountain sweetwater in the fountains and spas can wash away all your troubles. June was trained by the Gilfoyles, the hotel’s aristocratic owners, and she has guided the Avallon skillfully through the first pangs of war. Now, though, the Gilfoyle family heir has made a secret deal with the State Department to fill the hotel with captured Axis diplomats. June must convince her staff—many of whom have sons and husbands heading to the frontlines—to offer luxury to Nazis. With a smile. She also must reckon with Tucker Minnick, the FBI agent whose coal tattoo hints at their shared past in the mountains, and whose search for the diplomats’ secrets disrupts the peace June is fighting so hard to maintain. Hers is a balancing act with dangerous consequences; the sweetwater beneath the hotel can threaten as well as heal, and only June can manage the springs. As dark alliances and an elusive spy crack the polished veneer of the Avallon, June must calculate the true cost of luxury. ________________________________________________________________ Dabney: Over the past couple of years, I’ve become far more interested in historical fiction than I used to be. Perhaps it’s because I’ve found more books with female leads or maybe it’s because I’ve encountered reads that are NOT dual time-line, a fictional affectation I don’t love. For whatever reason, my favorite books of the past few years have been historical fiction–The Frozen River in 2023 and Eleanore of Avignon in 2024. The Listeners is already on my list of top books for 2025. For me, it was the perfect blend of storytelling, real history, compelling characters, and a nuanced view of the past. What did you think of it? Maggie: Frozen River is a terrific book. I would attribute all the characteristics you listed for The Listeners -the perfect blend of storytelling, real history, compelling characters, and a nuanced view of the past- as strengths of that novel. Most of my reading in recent years has been comprised of historicals set in the early to mid-20th century. I find I’ve grown particular about these stories since we both have such a plethora of information about the era that all the novels should easily capture the history of it, and because so many excellent writers are working within that milieu. This novel had a lot to live up to and I didn’t feel it quite hit the bar. With The Listeners, the story felt almost isolated, like everything was happening in a moment detached from the rest of reality, in an area so remote the everyday world didn’t intrude upon it. The magical surrealistic element of the sweetwater and June’s strange connection to it added to that sense of irreality and pulled it even further from the history of the period. How did you feel about that element of the tale? Dabney: I think that’s what I liked best about it! There are so so so many WWII books and, to me, they rarely show me anything new. This one, with its focus on this world apart, riveted me. The narrowness of its scope allowed me to really think about the characters, their motivations and responses to their circumstances. The larger world hovers outside the story and we know how it goes but, in the pages of the Listeners, individuals are revealed in their distinct complexity. Maggie: Interesting! I didn’t find any of them particularly nuanced. The bad guys were bad and the good guys good, who instinctively knew right from wrong. Did you feel there was ever a possibility that the characters who were presented as morally questionable would turn out to be the heroes and vice versa? Which characters did you feel represented that? Dabney: This is one of these conversations where I feel as if we read different books! I thought almost all the characters were nuanced. Even the leads, and especially June, make choices that were sort of iffy in some ways. And the guests, the Japanese and Germans, were fascinating to me. I was especially riveted by the story of the Wolfes, the German family whose loyalties were strained because of their daughter. Maggie: I didn’t feel the Wolfe&#8217;s loyalties were divided; there were lines they weren’t willing to cross even for their child. They loved her just enough to want to prevent her from dying, but I’m not sure they could even see the issue beyond her to the hundreds of other lives involved. I couldn&#8217;t help but compare it to the Smith family’s dilemma in Man in the High Castle and how they were forced to confront who they are, who they were, who they should be, and all the choices that led to their present predicament. (World at War does an interesting take on the issue as well.) There’s a strong romance here, what did you think of the love story? Dabney: I think one of the polarizing things about this book–which I liked–is that the Germans and the Japanese were portrayed more sympathetically than one usually sees in fiction about WWII. So, it’s true they didn’t care about the many many lives their nations were wreaking havoc on–they only cared about their own families. That was interesting to me–I’m always curious about the inner workings of the other. I liked the love story–and there are really two. I thought the point of both of the men in June’s life was to show her path to understanding what was right for her, both in her personal life and in her professional one. Her romances added heft to her story. Maggie: We’ve had very different reading experiences. I can remember only a handful of books where the Germans weren’t shown as capable of caring for their own family and friends, but they are almost always portrayed as not being able to care beyond that and see the humanity in others that aren’t exactly like them. I definitely saw some of that here in how the diplomats treated those from even their allied nations, which I found surprising. I’ve always thought of diplomacy as the art of reaching past cultural barriers. Regarding the romance,I felt that the book showed one of June’s suitors in an extremely negative light. He was presented first as a coward, afraid to go to war, then a backstabber who had sacrificed the hotel and its staff to meet his own needs, a womanizer whom she accepted a gift from with a skeptical belief that it had been intended for another of his paramours and then his final proposition was so full of self-interest that it made Mr. Darcy’s original proposal seem warm, romantic and effusive in praise. What, aside from the wealth, did you think made him a good suitor for her? Dabney: I didn’t make myself clear. One of the suitors is not a good guy and the other is. What I liked is that the focus was on June and how interacting with those men taught her about herself, her values, and what her life’s effort at the Avallon truly meant. Maggie: Ah! That makes sense. I agree that meeting Tucker and the diplomats helps her really see the world beyond the Avallon. Speaking of which, I felt the Avallon and the sweetwater congruent to it were characters in and of themselves. The Avallon had the same presence for me as the abode in a Gothic typically does, with possible ghosts, the peculiar magic of the sweetwater, and the huge role it plays in all our character&#8217;s lives. What did you think of the hotel itself? Would it be a destination you would want to stay at?

So, as I read the book, I kept imagining that hotel which is huge and glamorous and lovely. So, yes, I think I’d love to stay in the Avallon.

If they’re not analyzing themselves, they’re remembering or imagining sex, or unpacking the history of their relationship. The self-reflection is constant—drenched in therapy language, laced with a little woo-woo, and delivered without pause. It&#8217;s just page after page of characters naming their feelings out loud. It isn’t inauthentic, but it <strong>is</strong> exhausting.</p>\n<p>The world around them is just as curated. Their son is great. Their families are great.

She&#8217;d come back and spoon up the resulting mush. This book reminds me of that&#8211;all the snap, crackle, and pop of a great romance has, here, been turned into goo. It wasn&#8217;t for me. But, really, I won&#8217;t think less of you if you like it. I do get that, these days, we are looking for joy wherever we can find it. And this book is (relentlessly) upbeat. But me, well, I like my love stories with a crunch, not a squish—and maybe even a little bite.</p>\n",

The self-reflection is constant—drenched in therapy language, laced with a little woo-woo, and delivered without pause. It&#8217;s just page after page of characters naming their feelings out loud. It isn’t inauthentic, but it is exhausting. The world around them is just as curated. Their son is great. Their families are great. The three dead parents between them barely register. Everyone is kind, supportive, emotionally fluent, and entirely without any real issues. The book smooths every edge until there’s nothing left to push against. As I read, I thought about a college roommate of mine who&#8217;d get up in the morning, pour herself a bowl of Rice Krispies and milk, and then go shower. She&#8217;d come back and spoon up the resulting mush. This book reminds me of that&#8211;all the snap, crackle, and pop of a great romance has, here, been turned into goo. It wasn&#8217;t for me. But, really, I won&#8217;t think less of you if you like it. I do get that, these days, we are looking for joy wherever we can find it. And this book is (relentlessly) upbeat. But me, well, I like my love stories with a crunch, not a squish—and maybe even a little bite."

It’s not that the conflict is subtle; it’s that it’s stagnant.</p>\n<p>Hannah is a version of a heroine I’ve read too many times: professionally competent, romantically wary, and unable to believe she’s truly lovable. The novel seems to think this is depth, but it’s not. Her insecurities aren’t explored so much as recycled. Her internal monologue loops around the same tired doubts without ever interrogating them. Worse, she judges herself harshly for enjoying sex, referring to herself as “slutty” for sleeping with Drew even after they’ve established a connection. That’s not endearing—it’s regressive.</p>\n<p>Drew, meanwhile, is a fantasy so polished he barely registers as real. He’s handsome, generous, emotionally available, and apparently without a single ex-girlfriend. We’re told he’s tired of women pursuing him for his fame, but we’re shown none of that history. For the most eligible man in New Zealand, he’s curiously blank. His attraction to Hannah starts with her hair—he can’t stop picturing her naked with “moonlit strands” spilling across his pillow—and moves straight to true love. He’s not a character so much as a well-built vessel for adoration.</p>\n<p>And yet, despite the flimsy romance, there are moments that work. New Zealand is lovingly rendered, full of tactile, sunlit detail. The author captures the country with affection and specificity, and the landscape does far more emotional heavy lifting than the dialogue. James clearly knows and loves rugby and here, the sport is fun to follow. I also appreciated that the book didn’t pretend Hannah’s decision to move across the world was easy. It gestures, at least, toward the real uncertainty of building a life in a new place with a man you barely know.</p>\n<p>But gestures aren’t enough. The emotional payoff never quite lands because the emotional development isn’t there. Drew remains too good to be true. Hannah remains too self-sabotaging to believe.

It leans on the beauty of its setting and the fantasy of an uncomplicated hero, but never builds the emotional foundation that would make either matter.

I&#8217;m all for HEAs but this one and the bedroom hijinks that came with it just felt stale to me.&nbsp; Kayne: While I didn’t enjoy this one as much as some of her other books, I liked the theme of embracing life’s messiness and look forward to seeing what comes next from James. This is a B from me. Dabney: I&#8217;m going with a C. It&#8217;s not awful&#8211;James is a fun and very smart writer&#8211;but this one isn&#8217;t one of her best.&nbsp;"

But Bastone threads in something quieter, too: Ainsley sometimes misses her mom, Reese, whose job keeps her away more than either of them would like.

It expands the world, raises the stakes, and complicates its characters, yet in its effort to do more, it sometimes loses the tight, gripping focus that made <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/compass-and-blade-by-rachel-greenlaw/\"><strong>Compass and Blade</strong></a> so compelling. The story is always in motion, but not always with direction, and while it charts an intriguing course for the finale, it occasionally gets caught in its own currents.</p>\n<p>When the watch strike, burning her home to the ground, Mira teams up with Elijah, calling in her bargain to uncover the truth about her abilities and destroy Captain Renshaw and the watch. To do so, she’ll need help—from her friends and from the witches. Meanwhile, at Coven Septern, Hunter Brielle is tasked with an unusual mission: to track down a human girl. The Coven has never hunted humans before. The assignment feels wrong, but refusing orders isn’t just rebellion—it’s an identity crisis. Brielle was made to be a Hunter. If she questions her purpose, does she unravel herself in the process?</p>\n<p data-start=\"356\" data-end=\"1109\">Brielle’s conflict is the most interesting dilemma in the book. The Coven has always drawn a hard line—non-humans are the enemy, Hunters enforce the law. Now, that certainty is unraveling. The real question isn’t whether Mira is dangerous, but who gets to decide what <em>dangerous</em> means. Greenlaw doesn’t just hint at the politics behind it; she leans in, making it clear that here power about justice but rather control, that the ones in charge define <em>monster</em> however it suits them. It’s a compelling thread, adding depth to the world and tension to the story. But this isn’t Brielle’s book. <em data-start=\"944\" data-end=\"961\">Shadow and Tide</em> belongs to Mira, and while Brielle’s arc complicates the narrative in intriguing ways, she’s a piece of the larger puzzle, not the whole picture.</p>\n<p>Then there’s Eli. We finally get his backstory, which adds some needed depth, and his relationship with Mira continues to develop. The problem? It’s a slow burn that’s barely smoldering. The chemistry is there in theory, but in practice, it feels like a relationship built on meaningful glances and not much else. I don’t need them tearing each other’s clothes off, but I do need to feel something—urgency, tension, desire, anything beyond just quiet admiration. Right now, it’s more like a pleasant courtship in a drawing room than a romance forged in battle.</p>\n<p>Pacing-wise, the book moves fast—sometimes too fast. The action sequences pile up like waves in a storm, relentless but not always distinct, while the quieter moments feel more like enforced stops than natural shifts in rhythm. Greenlaw can write tension, but the book needed a steadier hand at the wheel. And, of course, there’s a cliffhanger—because this is romantasy, and that’s the law. Does it make me desperate for book three? No. But am I going to read it? Yes.</p>\n<p>Because for all its unevenness, <strong>Shadow and Tide</strong> still holds the course. It expands the world, sharpens the stakes, and introduces questions that should make for an explosive finale. Book three has a choice: steer this series toward something unforgettable or let it sink into the ordinary. Right now, I’m still on board—but I’m not holding my breath.</p>\n",

It’s a compelling thread, adding depth to the world and tension to the story. But this isn’t Brielle’s book. Shadow and Tide belongs to Mira, and while Brielle’s arc complicates the narrative in intriguing ways, she’s a piece of the larger puzzle, not the whole picture. Then there’s Eli. We finally get his backstory, which adds some needed depth, and his relationship with Mira continues to develop. The problem? It’s a slow burn that’s barely smoldering. The chemistry is there in theory, but in practice, it feels like a relationship built on meaningful glances and not much else. I don’t need them tearing each other’s clothes off, but I do need to feel something—urgency, tension, desire, anything beyond just quiet admiration. Right now, it’s more like a pleasant courtship in a drawing room than a romance forged in battle. Pacing-wise, the book moves fast—sometimes too fast. The action sequences pile up like waves in a storm, relentless but not always distinct, while the quieter moments feel more like enforced stops than natural shifts in rhythm. Greenlaw can write tension, but the book needed a steadier hand at the wheel. And, of course, there’s a cliffhanger—because this is romantasy, and that’s the law. Does it make me desperate for book three? No. But am I going to read it? Yes. Because for all its unevenness, Shadow and Tide still holds the course. It expands the world, sharpens the stakes, and introduces questions that should make for an explosive finale. Book three has a choice: steer this series toward something unforgettable or let it sink into the ordinary. Right now, I’m still on board—but I’m not holding my breath."

That’s all it takes for McAllister to unravel a marriage, a career, and a life in real time. This isn’t a thriller that relies on cheap tricks or high body counts to keep you hooked.

It should be an ordinary milestone, one her husband, Luke, should be there to support. Instead, she finds a note—just ambiguous enough to be troubling but not clear enough to explain anything. Minutes later, the police arrive. Luke isn’t missing. He’s the gunman in a hostage crisis unfolding across London. And just like that, Cam’s life detonates.</p>\n<p>McAllister structures the novel in three acts, each with its own rhythm and weight. The first is pure adrenaline, a masterclass in controlled chaos. Cam’s world unravels at breakneck speed, and McAllister doesn’t give either her or the reader room to breathe. The unanswered texts, the eerie normalcy of her morning before the news broke, the creeping horror that she might not have truly known Luke at all—every moment pulses with dread.</p>\n<p>Then comes the second act, where the novel shifts from external catastrophe to internal reckoning. The siege is over, but Cam is still trapped—this time, in the aftermath. She pieces together what happened alongside hostage negotiator Niall, a man undone by that same day. A single misstep cost him his career, his marriage, and any semblance of peace. McAllister lets ambiguity fester. Was Luke completely not who Cam thought he was? Is Niall the solution to Cam’s questions or is he something far darker? The reader doesn’t know—every action revealed could have any number of explanations.</p>\n<p>The final act is where McAllister’s skill truly shines. Every breadcrumb laid in the early pages leads to a conclusion that is as shocking as it is inevitable. There’s no final-hour gimmick, no twist for the sake of a twist.

Cam isn’t a plucky heroine or a tragic victim—she’s messy, stubborn, and fully human. Her love of books—her tendency to escape into fiction as a way to process the world—will make readers of genre fiction happy.

But thanks to his temper, an injury, and bad luck, he’s broke and hasn’t hit a ball in months. Worse, three years ago, his son—now seven-year-old Dylan—landed in his lap out of nowhere after the kid’s maternal grandparents dropped him off. Fatherhood wasn’t the plan, but Ryan is adapting, screwing up, and trying again. He’s depressed, stressed, and overwhelmed. The wife of a former teammate decides he needs help and, over his objections, sends her friend Kate to his door to be the nanny.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Wouldn’t you know it—Ryan and Kate had a one-night stand five years ago. It was fun, it was hot, and then they moved on. This isn’t a <i>one who got away</i> story, which is a relief. Neither of them have spent the past five years pining, wondering <i>what if</i>. They lived their lives separately until fate (and Ryan’s inability to make it to school pickup on time) threw them back together.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Now, Kate and Ryan are face-to-face again, forced to deal with a crackling attraction neither of them asked for but can’t seem to avoid. Ryan <i>can’t</i> sleep with Kate. He—in a plot point I found beyond unconvincing—has been celibate for three years out of some noble desire to be a good dad. But the conflict here isn’t really about Dylan—Kate is, of course, fabulous with him. The supposed obstacle is that Ryan is technically Kate’s boss, but that’s a flimsy barrier at best. These two can’t be in the same room without wanting to rip each other’s clothes off. They <i>try</i> to resist, but it’s half-hearted at best. There’s no real push-and-pull, no deeper emotional hesitation—just an agreement to <i>try</i> not to sleep together, which lasts all of five minutes.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Ryan <i>should</i> be a great character. He’s a struggling single dad, a former athlete trying to rebuild, and he has a painkiller addiction that could have added real depth to his story. But the book never fully commits to his struggles. His addiction, for example, is more of a convenient subplot than a defining obstacle, and the deeper emotional weight of his transition from athlete to father never really lands.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Kate, meanwhile, is an odd mix of qualities. She’s great with Dylan, natural mom material, although she, like Emily and Tara—the heroines of the first two books—is ambivalent about having kids. It’s interesting that Kriss keeps writing women whose romances won’t necessarily end with babies. That’s not a complaint—just a notable choice in a genre that often assumes a love story leads straight to a nursery. But Kate isn’t particularly invested in anything other than Ryan and, to her credit, Dylan. She verges on being the poster child for the lost Gen Z-er who can’t commit—to a career, a hobby, a home, or a life—because… reasons.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">One of the best things about this series is the Riggs brothers themselves, and <strong>Work Me Up</strong> delivers plenty of their sharp, snarky banter.

It’s a place young people leave as soon as they can—and come back to when elsewhere’s charms fail. In <strong>Drive Me Wild</strong>, both Luke Riggs and Emily Parker took off at eighteen, convinced they’d never return. Now, at twenty-six, they’re back.</p>\n<p>Luke isn’t home by choice. His shitheel of a father is in prison, and someone has to keep the family’s body shop from imploding. No one expects him to succeed—they’ve spent his entire life waiting for him to fail. Emily, on the other hand, has returned to celebrate her mother’s career milestone. She should be feeling proud, but with no job—she lost her last internship because, <em>a world of ugh</em>, she didn&#8217;t smile enough—no boyfriend, and no real plan, she’s unmoored in a way that makes her lost and just a bit embarrassed.</p>\n<p>Then she sees Luke.</p>\n<p>Eight years ago, without telling a soul, the cop&#8217;s daughter and the criminal&#8217;s son spent a summer in each other&#8217;s arms. The sex was incredible, but both were sure it would never work. So, off Emily went to college, while Luke took off for parts unknown, and that was supposed to be the end of it. But now they’re both in Westlake, and from the moment Luke runs into Emily at a gas station, it&#8217;s profoundly clear that whatever they had is nowhere near done.</p>\n<p>At first, Emily is determined to stay away. She&#8217;s already trying to map a new future for herself, and she sure doesn&#8217;t need to get distracted by Luke’s sexy abs and knowing manner. She can do better, she tells herself. But somehow, every time she runs into Luke—and very quickly, this involves getting naked—he makes her feel so at ease. And given that she&#8217;s learning to trust herself, she slowly realizes that Luke, who loves her for her strengths and her flaws, might be more than just the best lay in the land.</p>\n<p>Luke too is flawed in ways that make him feel real. He’s exhausted, frustrated, and his temper runs too hot, but he’s also a good man. He’s not interested in convincing anyone he’s changed—he just does the work. His bond with his brothers is one of the novel’s best elements. The Riggs men are a collective mess, but their loyalty, though tangled in dysfunction, is unshakable. They’re better together, and they know it.</p>\n<p>And by the way—this book is SEXY. The love scenes aren’t just boxes to check. They hum with tension, history, and raw emotion. Desire here isn’t just about attraction. It’s about recognition, about knowing exactly who the other person is and wanting them anyway. Both Luke and Emily are wonderfully direct about what they want between the sheets—their pillow talk rivals that of almost any I’ve recently read.</p>\n<p>Even better, our leads don’t exist in a vacuum. Emily’s relationship with her twin sister, Lauren, feels lived-in, full of unspoken understanding and the occasional exasperation. The contrast between the Parkers’ traditional, seemingly happy family and the Riggs brothers’ barely contained chaos makes for an interesting backdrop. Kriss is superb at creating distinctive characters and at portraying a struggling small-town America complete with unemployment checks, drug addiction, and divorce. For a short work, the world-building here is impressive.</p>\n<p>The external conflict—Luke struggling to keep the body shop afloat while the police (including Emily’s mother) keep an eye on him—adds just enough pressure to keep things moving. I wanted more resolution there, but honestly? The heart of this book is Emily and Luke, and they more than carried the story.</p>\n<p>That said, <strong>Drive Me Wild</strong> asks you to buy into the idea that one teenage summer of sweaty, superlative, star-crossed sex is enough to cement an unshakable forever. Luke and Emily certainly do—so much so that, in the now, they spend far more time in bed (or against walls, or on tables) than they do talking. I did wonder about their ability to weather life’s woes—nothing in the epilogue suggests they’ll handle conflict with words rather than with whatever flat surface is closest at hand. Which, let’s be honest, could go either way.</p>\n<p>A sharp, sexy, and absorbing second-chance romance with a heroine who refuses to dim her light and a hero who wouldn’t want her to.

Farrow is sure there&#8217;s something odd about a set of murders that have plagued the city but he&#8217;s just not sure what&#8217;s going on.&nbsp; Neither is the reader. The novel&#8211;337 pages long&#8211;plods along as Amanda and Ruth work out their pain and bad things happen about the city. Amanda fixates on avenging her daughter’s death, while Ruth spirals into paranoia, convinced her attacker is lurking around every corner. Their connection remains murky until page 259, when Cavanagh finally drops a clue meant to upend everything. Instead, it&#8217;s a dud, a withheld piece of info that changes all that&#8217;s come before. It’s not just the plot that disappoints. The writing is stiff, the pacing clunky, and the American setting riddled with errors—Cavanagh’s Irish roots show in awkward ways, from clumsy dialogue to factual inaccuracies about New York City and U.S. culture. The last 80 pages of the novel offer a giant twist that makes no sense and, even worse, offers brutal violence in lieu of any kind of justice. The epilogue is bizarre. Believe me when I tell you, I couldn’t WAIT to finish this book. Cavanaugh is the author of the acclaimed Eddie Flynn books which, I confess, I’ve not read. I’m going to assume they’re much better than this.&nbsp;"

Eleanore is an herbalist, a gifted one. Her mother, now dead from childbirth, was the city&#8217;s midwife and, some say, witch. Eleanore has inherited both her mother&#8217;s mantle and, Eleanore&#8217;s most prized possession, her book of herbal healing: <em>Dog-eared and water-stained, it contains all her remedies: medicines to start contractions when a baby will not come, for toothaches and gripe, to soothe winter coughs and ease swelling in painful joints.</em></p>\n<p>As Eleanore walks back to the home she shares with her sister, Margot, her father, and their maid, Anes, she hears the usual sounds of stone masons shouting and of hammer blows.

The current pope, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Clement-VI\">Clement VI</a>, a man known for his love of luxury, is building a new palace fit for a king. And though his reign over the church is relatively unchallenged, the rule of the land is contested. Eleanore and her sister Margot support <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanna_I_of_Naples\">Queen Joanna</a>, Queen of Naples and Countess of Provence, who soon will travel to Avignon to stand trial for the murder of her first husband, Andreas.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A few days later, as Eleanore is again out hunting for herbs&#8211;she finds a rare bounty of hawthorn berries (<em>The fruit is cleansing and acidic; it decreases swelling and produces copious urine in someone with too much water in their body.</em>)&#8211;she encounters a giant of a man. He asks her for the berries&#8211;he is, he says, a physician and he needs them for a patient. He is at first startled at Eleanore&#8217;s knowledge of the plant&#8217;s powers.

There’s something almost chemical about the way her flawed-but-magnetic characters, lush historical detail, and intricately woven plots come together—they form stories that don’t just entertain; they absorb. Her novels lodge themselves somewhere under your skin, simmering long after you’ve turned the final page.</p>\n<p><strong>Written on Your Skin</strong>, one of her very best, opens in Hong Kong, 1880, at a party thick with heat and hidden motives. Phineas Granville, a spy embittered by both service and survival, stands at the edge of the room, watching gorgeous and wild American Miss Mina Masters weave her way toward him. Once upon a time, Phin flirted with chatty, vapid Mina, hoping to use her to help dismantle the arms-dealing network of her stepfather, Collins. But, in the end, Phin didn&#8217;t need her and now he wants nothing more than to leave Hong Kong behind, Mina included. That plan crumbles the moment Mina follows him into a dark hallway and plants an unwanted kiss on his mouth. Moments after Phin shoves her away, he crashes to the floor, realizing—too late—that the brandy he just drank was poisoned.</p>\n<p>Mina, who has mastered the art of being underestimated, recognizes that Phin is not the ordinary spy he pretends to be. As the belladonna courses through his veins, Phin lets slip secrets about Collins—details the businessman he is claiming to be would never know. Despising her stepfather for the brutal way he treats her mother and betting Phin may be able to help her destroy him, Mina makes a split-second decision: she will save Phin’s life, a choice that costs her dearly.</p>\n<p>Four years later, Mina, now a successful businesswoman thriving in New York, is in London and terrified. Her mother is missing, and Collins has escaped the prison Phin’s efforts put him in. Alone in a foreign city, Mina has only one person she believes she can trust—the newly minted, reluctantly titled Earl of Ashmore. Phin. He owes her. And Mina intends to collect.</p>\n<p>The brilliance of <strong>Written on Your Skin </strong>lies not just in the hypnotic courtship between its protagonists but also in the historical forces that quietly shape the story’s architecture. By the 1880s, the British Empire was fraying, its control spread thin across colonies like Hong Kong, India, and Egypt. Yet even as it clung to dominance, paranoia infected its policies, particularly in Ireland, where the rising tide of home rule movements and whispered uprisings kept British officials jittery. Espionage became both obsession and necessity, the Crown recruiting agents to sniff out threats before they could bloom. Phin’s transformation from a quiet mapmaker into a government weapon isn’t just backstory—it’s the story of an empire so desperate to maintain power that it corrupts its own citizens, twisting ordinary men into tools of control. Mina’s journey, too, unfolds against the backdrop of imperial hubris. As a woman who has spent her life manipulating a world built for men, Mina understands rebellion better than most. Whether in politics, love, or family, dissent carries consequences. Duran weaves this tension so deftly into the novel that it feels less like a setting than an unspoken force, shifting the stakes of every interaction.</p>\n<p>In this context of paranoia and danger, Phin and Mina&#8211;this is, after all, a romance&#8211;fall in love. But Phin and Mina’s romance isn’t just a love story—it’s an intricate dance between two people who don’t trust anyone, least of all themselves. Phin was drawn into espionage by the promise of mapmaking, and, instead, was manipulated by his handler, an odious man named Ridland, who preyed on Phin’s worst instincts and shaped him into a killer. Inheriting a title finally gave Phin just enough leverage to claw his way out from Ridland’s control, and now Phin’s is determined to oust Ridland from the Service altogether. But freedom that came with his peerage hasn&#8217;t really freed Phin&#8211;he carries deep scars from his past missions, haunted by PTSD and steeped in self-loathing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Mina, for her part, has spent her life watching how power confines women, reducing their choices to nothing. She saw her mother trapped under the brutal hand of Collins, and she vowed never to let any man control her. Mina’s weapons of choice are her beauty and charm—men, she’s learned, are easiest to manage when they believe you’re nothing more than a beautiful thing. But Phin is immune to her tricks. He sees through her, and instead of frustrating her, that clarity fascinates her. For the first time, Mina begins to reveal pieces of her real self—not just as a tactic but because Phin’s mind proves irresistible.</p>\n<p>The chemistry between Phin and Mina is more than just sparks; it’s alchemy. Their slow-burn romance unfolds like a symphony of longing and restraint, banter and unspoken truths. Duran’s love scenes aren’t rushed—they unfurl in waves of tension and intimacy, exposing not just desire but vulnerability. Many romance writers will tell you that the best love scenes show how two characters feel about each other. Duran goes deeper—her love scenes strip her characters down to their rawest selves, revealing the messy, complicated people they are beneath their masks. In their physical connection, Phin and Mina don’t just find fleeting pleasure—they discover the beginnings of being the selves they never share with the world.</p>\n<p>In Duran’s world, love is not a cure-all; it’s deeply worthwhile work. Phin and Mina carry their scars with them, and love doesn’t magically make them disappear. Instead, they earn their happy ending by choosing to try, over and over again, to believe they are worthy of love. Their journey is jagged and uncertain, filled with setbacks and small victories that feel painfully honest. Duran’s portrayal of love isn’t neat—it’s messy, complicated, and real in a way few romances dare to be.</p>\n<p>If all that weren&#8217;t enough, <strong>Written on Your Skin</strong> is hewn with stunning prose. Duran writes with an elegance that lingers on the page. Every setting—whether it’s the crowded streets of London or a smoke-filled parlor—feels alive with detail. You can almost smell the lemon oil on the wood, feel the weight of a velvet curtain against your hand, or sense the sky darkening as the clock ticks on.

I had high hopes—her previous novel, <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/compass-and-blade-by-rachel-greenlaw/\"><strong>Compass and Blade</strong></a>, was a standout, and comparisons to <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/the-spellshop-by-sarah-beth-durst/\">Adrienne Young</a> set my expectations even higher. But somewhere in the pages, the story begins to lose the thread, as if unsure whether to lean into its magic or unravel it.</p>\n<p>Woodsmoke, nestled beneath brooding mountains, is both setting and character—a place that feels hostile in the way only small towns steeped in secrets can. The Morgan women, a dwindling line of witches, sit at the center of this story. Carrie Morgan returns after the death of her grandmother, Ivy, to claim her inheritance—a cottage and a store—and confront the legacy she’s spent years trying to outrun. Her mother remains a shadow in the narrative, having fled years ago, leaving the weight of their magic on Carrie’s shoulders. Ivy’s sister, Cora, remains in Woodsmoke, a prickly presence who casts spells for the townsfolk from the family’s ancient book, her power a lifeline as much as it is a burden.</p>\n<p>Carrie, restless and rootless for the past decade, hopes this return might finally settle something inside her. But the town she left is the same town that remembers—most painfully through Jess, Carrie’s former best friend, now married to Tom, the man Carrie never quite stopped loving. What follows is a story thick with tensions that simmer rather than spark.</p>\n<p>Then, of course, a man appears. A stranger arriving with the season’s first frost, Matthieu is more myth than man—a figure straight out of Woodsmoke lore, said to charm Morgan women only to vanish come spring. Carrie, predictably drawn to him, ignores Cora’s blunt warnings, letting herself get swept into his orbit.

                "text": "Rachel Greenlaw’s The Woodsmoke Women’s Book of Spells opens with intrigue but fizzles before it can fully cast its spell. I had high hopes—her previous novel, Compass and Blade, was a standout, and comparisons to Adrienne Young set my expectations even higher. But somewhere in the pages, the story begins to lose the thread, as if unsure whether to lean into its magic or unravel it. Woodsmoke, nestled beneath brooding mountains, is both setting and character—a place that feels hostile in the way only small towns steeped in secrets can. The Morgan women, a dwindling line of witches, sit at the center of this story. Carrie Morgan returns after the death of her grandmother, Ivy, to claim her inheritance—a cottage and a store—and confront the legacy she’s spent years trying to outrun. Her mother remains a shadow in the narrative, having fled years ago, leaving the weight of their magic on Carrie’s shoulders. Ivy’s sister, Cora, remains in Woodsmoke, a prickly presence who casts spells for the townsfolk from the family’s ancient book, her power a lifeline as much as it is a burden. Carrie, restless and rootless for the past decade, hopes this return might finally settle something inside her. But the town she left is the same town that remembers—most painfully through Jess, Carrie’s former best friend, now married to Tom, the man Carrie never quite stopped loving. What follows is a story thick with tensions that simmer rather than spark. Then, of course, a man appears. A stranger arriving with the season’s first frost, Matthieu is more myth than man—a figure straight out of Woodsmoke lore, said to charm Morgan women only to vanish come spring. Carrie, predictably drawn to him, ignores Cora’s blunt warnings, letting herself get swept into his orbit. Jess, meanwhile, spirals into jealousy, convinced Carrie has come back to ruin her marriage. The novel alternates between Carrie, Jess, and Cora’s perspectives—a structure that should deepen the narrative but instead exposes the limits of the characters. Carrie feels too passive, Jess too predictable, and Cora’s sharpness starts to grate. What begins as promising insight into their inner lives becomes a feedback loop, circling the same conflicts without much evolution. The men—Matthieu, Tom, and Cora’s husband Howard—drift through the story like props. They exist to move plot points forward, but none are compelling enough to stand on their own. Whether this was a deliberate choice or not, it leaves them feeling hollow, their presence never quite resonating. The novel plays with magic but never fully commits.

It&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2024/08/20/creation-lake-rachel-kushner-review/\"><em>vital and profound</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/02/books/review/creation-lake-rachel-kushner.html\"><em>it consolidates Kushner’s status as one of finest novelists working in the English language</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://magazine.columbia.edu/article/review-creation-lake-rachel-kushner\"><em>daring, witty, and intensely cerebral</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Nope.</p>\n<p>The book is a slog—it&#8217;s dense, meandering, routinely pointless, and filled with characters who are, without exception, deeply unlikable. It feels like the kind of book beloved by <em>very serious people</em>, but it’s hard to imagine anyone with a brain <em>and</em> a soul enjoying it. I know I didn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>The book begins in rural southern France in the 2010s. Our narrator, currently called Sadie Smith, is a shallow, morally bankrupt spy with breast implants&#8211;they are mentioned frequently&#8211;and bland good looks who has nothing interesting or kind to say. It&#8217;s as if Amy from <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/gone-girl-gillian-flynn/\"><strong>Gone Girl</strong> </a>had a supercilious child with no good reason for her horrible behavior and who has none of her mother&#8217;s sense of humor or wit. We know little about Sadie&#8217;s background other than she&#8217;s a crap human being who was dismissed by the FBI for going too far in a previous mission. She now freelances for scummy private employers which she likes better because there&#8217;s less oversight and thus she has more time to drink, sleep around, and sneer at others.</p>\n<p>Sadie, for reasons never made clear, is currently tasked with infiltrating a commune that opposes monocrop corn farming and a megabasin, both of which, the commune believes (probably correctly), will damage the land. Sadie is looking for evidence of criminality that, if she can&#8217;t find, she&#8217;ll create. When she&#8217;s not hanging out with the commune&#8211;all of whom are equally unappealing&#8211;she&#8217;s obsessing over a trove of emails from a man named Bruno, one of the original founders of the group&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Bruno, who now lives in a cave, has, over the years, sent emails to the commune on topics ranging from Neanderthals to obscure historical groups like the Cagot. (Sadie is unable to find any actual illegal ruminations in his work.) Surprisingly, these digital missives are genuinely interesting, especially when paired with quick Wikipedia searches to fill in the gaps. I&#8217;d have enjoyed this book more had it only been lessons from Bruno.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, much of the novel focuses on Sadie and her efforts to take down the commune which she infiltrates easily. I had a hard time believing this group was capable of much of anything.

                "text": "Rachel Kushner&#8217;s Creation Lake has been met with rapturous praise. It&#8217;s vital and profound, it consolidates Kushner’s status as one of finest novelists working in the English language, and daring, witty, and intensely cerebral.&nbsp; Nope. The book is a slog—it&#8217;s dense, meandering, routinely pointless, and filled with characters who are, without exception, deeply unlikable. It feels like the kind of book beloved by very serious people, but it’s hard to imagine anyone with a brain and a soul enjoying it. I know I didn&#8217;t. The book begins in rural southern France in the 2010s. Our narrator, currently called Sadie Smith, is a shallow, morally bankrupt spy with breast implants&#8211;they are mentioned frequently&#8211;and bland good looks who has nothing interesting or kind to say. It&#8217;s as if Amy from Gone Girl had a supercilious child with no good reason for her horrible behavior and who has none of her mother&#8217;s sense of humor or wit. We know little about Sadie&#8217;s background other than she&#8217;s a crap human being who was dismissed by the FBI for going too far in a previous mission. She now freelances for scummy private employers which she likes better because there&#8217;s less oversight and thus she has more time to drink, sleep around, and sneer at others. Sadie, for reasons never made clear, is currently tasked with infiltrating a commune that opposes monocrop corn farming and a megabasin, both of which, the commune believes (probably correctly), will damage the land. Sadie is looking for evidence of criminality that, if she can&#8217;t find, she&#8217;ll create. When she&#8217;s not hanging out with the commune&#8211;all of whom are equally unappealing&#8211;she&#8217;s obsessing over a trove of emails from a man named Bruno, one of the original founders of the group&nbsp; Bruno, who now lives in a cave, has, over the years, sent emails to the commune on topics ranging from Neanderthals to obscure historical groups like the Cagot. (Sadie is unable to find any actual illegal ruminations in his work.) Surprisingly, these digital missives are genuinely interesting, especially when paired with quick Wikipedia searches to fill in the gaps. I&#8217;d have enjoyed this book more had it only been lessons from Bruno.&nbsp; However, much of the novel focuses on Sadie and her efforts to take down the commune which she infiltrates easily. I had a hard time believing this group was capable of much of anything. The men spend their days drinking, hammering on things, and philosophizing, while the women smoke, gossip, and pay little attention to their squalling kids. Kushner presents this dynamic as the “natural order” of things, particularly in France. If I were French, I might be offended.&nbsp; The book does have brief moments of dark humor and absurdity, but they’re too few and far between. By the time I reached the final pages, I was skimming, hoping against hope that maybe something interesting might occur. It did not. Creation Lake feels less like a book meant to be read and enjoyed, and more like one crafted to spark discussion and win praise in rarified literary circles. Unsurprisingly, it has been long-listed for the National Book Award and short-listed for the Booker.

They land in a rundown apartment with their prized possession—a Dolly Parton statue, because who wouldn&#8217;t value a statue of Dolly above all? Somewhat problematically, their neighbor across the hall is Derek, a lieutenant with a badge, a bad attitude, and about as much charm as a parking ticket.

But he’s curious enough about Ginger’s situation (the best ass he&#8217;s ever seen) to run a background check (because nothing says “potential love interest” like mild surveillance). Soon enough, he starts connecting the dots: Ginger’s mom has a rap sheet longer than Derek’s patience, and it’s clear Ginger and Willa didn’t move for the fresh air.</p>\n<p>Derek’s approach to romance lacks even a hint of subtlety. If you&#8217;re into sweet, poetic declarations of love, you might want to sit this one out. Derek’s style is less &#8220;roses and serenades&#8221; and more “I want you in my bed, and by the way, I might handcuff you if you don’t move fast enough.” Case in point: <em>I want to be buried inside you so deep I have to remind you of your own name</em>. Subtle? No. Effective? Absolutely, because Ginger, for all her sharp edges, is completely here for it.</p>\n<p>That’s the beauty of their dynamic—Ginger doesn’t just tolerate Derek’s caveman routine; she revels in it&#8211;she&#8217;s had so much on her plate that she kinda never got around to orgasmic bliss. Derek, Ginger correctly intuits, wants control of her body so that he can drive her out of her mind again and again. It&#8217;s easy to see why she falls for his bossy talk. As for Derek, he&#8217;s a goner for Ginger. He spends his entire workday maintaining control, only to completely lose it the minute Ginger walks into the room. It’s possessive, it’s a little ridiculous, and it’s wildly entertaining.</p>\n<p>While Derek is busy asserting his alpha status, Ginger’s not sitting around. She’s fiercely protective of her sister, handles her bartending job with a no-nonsense attitude, and refuses to let Derek’s protective streak define her. The relationship she has with Willa is one of the highlights—genuine, funny, and refreshingly free of the usual sisterly rivalry nonsense. It’s rare to see female characters who can joke with each other without devolving into stereotypes.</p>\n<p>The novel has its problems, especially in the last 20% where the story takes a left turn into melodrama, with a big dramatic event that feels like it stumbled in from another genre entirely. It doesn’t ruin the book, but it does feel like someone cranked up the dial just when things were humming along. Also, while we get plenty of heat between Derek and Ginger, the emotional arc of their relationship could use a bit more time to breathe. You almost wish they&#8217;d talked as much as they, well, <em>did everything else</em>.</p>\n<p>But here’s the thing: despite its occasional missteps, <strong>Protecting What&#8217;s His </strong>knows exactly what it’s doing. It’s bold, a little bonkers, and unapologetically sexy. If you like your romance with a side of snark, a load of dirty talk, and characters who can’t stop circling each other like cats with too much attitude, this one’s for you. It&#8217;s a very sexy, good time.&nbsp;</p>\n",

Subtle? No. Effective? Absolutely, because Ginger, for all her sharp edges, is completely here for it. That’s the beauty of their dynamic—Ginger doesn’t just tolerate Derek’s caveman routine; she revels in it&#8211;she&#8217;s had so much on her plate that she kinda never got around to orgasmic bliss. Derek, Ginger correctly intuits, wants control of her body so that he can drive her out of her mind again and again. It&#8217;s easy to see why she falls for his bossy talk. As for Derek, he&#8217;s a goner for Ginger. He spends his entire workday maintaining control, only to completely lose it the minute Ginger walks into the room. It’s possessive, it’s a little ridiculous, and it’s wildly entertaining. While Derek is busy asserting his alpha status, Ginger’s not sitting around. She’s fiercely protective of her sister, handles her bartending job with a no-nonsense attitude, and refuses to let Derek’s protective streak define her. The relationship she has with Willa is one of the highlights—genuine, funny, and refreshingly free of the usual sisterly rivalry nonsense. It’s rare to see female characters who can joke with each other without devolving into stereotypes. The novel has its problems, especially in the last 20% where the story takes a left turn into melodrama, with a big dramatic event that feels like it stumbled in from another genre entirely. It doesn’t ruin the book, but it does feel like someone cranked up the dial just when things were humming along. Also, while we get plenty of heat between Derek and Ginger, the emotional arc of their relationship could use a bit more time to breathe. You almost wish they&#8217;d talked as much as they, well, did everything else. But here’s the thing: despite its occasional missteps, Protecting What&#8217;s His knows exactly what it’s doing. It’s bold, a little bonkers, and unapologetically sexy. If you like your romance with a side of snark, a load of dirty talk, and characters who can’t stop circling each other like cats with too much attitude, this one’s for you. It&#8217;s a very sexy, good time.&nbsp;"

Watching them unravel that fear is part of what makes the payoff feel earned, rather than just expected.</p>\n<p><em>Sugar Creek</em> has all the heat you’d want from a contemporary romance, but it’s not just about the fireworks. Toni Blake has a knack for weaving in emotional depth without turning things melodramatic, and her characters feel lived-in and flawed in ways that make them easy to root for. The small-town charm is there, but it’s the layers underneath—the hesitations, the regrets, the unspoken wounds—that keep you hooked. If you’re looking for a love story that’s not just about the falling but about the figuring out, this one hits the mark.</p>\n",

The “it’s just a fling” act does wear thin after a while, and watching them drag their feet through denial gets frustrating, but in a way, that’s part of the point. Both Mike and Rachel are people who don’t know how to let go of their defenses. It’s not just that they don’t believe in love; it’s that they don’t trust it, not after the things they’ve experienced. Watching them unravel that fear is part of what makes the payoff feel earned, rather than just expected. Sugar Creek has all the heat you’d want from a contemporary romance, but it’s not just about the fireworks. Toni Blake has a knack for weaving in emotional depth without turning things melodramatic, and her characters feel lived-in and flawed in ways that make them easy to root for. The small-town charm is there, but it’s the layers underneath—the hesitations, the regrets, the unspoken wounds—that keep you hooked. If you’re looking for a love story that’s not just about the falling but about the figuring out, this one hits the mark."

Marriage to the perfect guy, a thriving career, and a gorgeous condo overlooking San Francisco Bay. Then out of nowhere, her husband, Austin, left her. Ironic, because Chelsea fixes marriages for a living. In fact, she’s famous for her techniques. Naturally, she’s been using her expertise to win back her ex—and when he invites her for drinks, she’s sure her work has finally paid off. Until he announces he’s engaged.</p>\n<p>Devastated, Chelsea seeks refuge in the beloved small-town lake cabin she and Austin now take turns using. When she arrives, the streets are dazzlingly decked out for Halloween, the autumn leaves are exceptionally vibrant, and the locals are especially warm and welcoming. It’s downright magical—and so is Knox Hart, a talented jack-of-all-trades who’s fixing her roof. Chelsea is instantly drawn to him—and to the simplicity of country life. Slowly, she becomes immersed in the townspeople’s problems and finds a sense of belonging—leading her to reevaluate her own path . . .</p>\n<p>But something about the idyllic hamlet—and Knox—seems too good to be true. A trick more than a treat. And when she ultimately learns the truth, her heart is shattered. Miraculously, Austin is there to mend it. It’s everything she’d hoped for. Or is it?

With no time to woo, Dominic decides to marry his fiancée’s unconventional sister. Torie isn’t perfect, but their kisses are so passionate that society thinks he’s actually chosen her.</p>\n<p>Torie has never been able to make sense of words on a page, so she has turned her talents to art. She longs for a man who values her as she is… but marries for the sake of the twins. She doubts Dominic is capable of love, let alone respect, but as their heated debates turn into something more, Torie begins to imagine a life as a wife, not a nanny.</p>\n<p>But when the arrogant viscount finds that his viscountess has stolen his heart, he’ll have to give all he has to win her love.</p></blockquote>\n<hr>\n<div><strong>Kayne</strong>: This is my favorite historical romance I’ve read this year. I adored both the heroine and the hero in the story, despite his flaws and the romance was hot.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><strong>Viscount in Love</strong> is the first book in the <em>Accidental Brides</em> series. In it, Viscount Dominic Kelbourne suddenly becomes the guardian to his twin niece and nephew after his sister and her husband pass away in a carriage accident. His fiancé, Leonora, whom he thought would be the perfect wife to help him with his political career, suddenly elopes with another Lord and leaves him in need of a bride to help him with his new wards.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>His eye falls on Leonora’s sister Torie. She is wonderful with the twins, she’s lovely and kind, and the more he&#8217;s around her, he finds himself attracted to her, so he visits her father and offers for her. It&#8217;s not, he thinks, love, but it will work.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Dominic has his faults but I really liked his character. He is known for his temper (he bellows in the House of Lords) but I like that he owns up to his mistakes. He’ll say the wrong thing and accidentally insult someone but then realizes it immediately and apologizes. I found him appealing and, regularly, funny.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Torie is one of my favorite historical heroines.

                "text": "Suddenly guardian to twins, Viscount Dominic Kelbourne is luckily betrothed to a suitable lady—until she elopes. With no time to woo, Dominic decides to marry his fiancée’s unconventional sister. Torie isn’t perfect, but their kisses are so passionate that society thinks he’s actually chosen her. Torie has never been able to make sense of words on a page, so she has turned her talents to art. She longs for a man who values her as she is… but marries for the sake of the twins. She doubts Dominic is capable of love, let alone respect, but as their heated debates turn into something more, Torie begins to imagine a life as a wife, not a nanny. But when the arrogant viscount finds that his viscountess has stolen his heart, he’ll have to give all he has to win her love. Kayne: This is my favorite historical romance I’ve read this year. I adored both the heroine and the hero in the story, despite his flaws and the romance was hot. &nbsp; Viscount in Love is the first book in the Accidental Brides series. In it, Viscount Dominic Kelbourne suddenly becomes the guardian to his twin niece and nephew after his sister and her husband pass away in a carriage accident. His fiancé, Leonora, whom he thought would be the perfect wife to help him with his political career, suddenly elopes with another Lord and leaves him in need of a bride to help him with his new wards. &nbsp; His eye falls on Leonora’s sister Torie. She is wonderful with the twins, she’s lovely and kind, and the more he&#8217;s around her, he finds himself attracted to her, so he visits her father and offers for her. It&#8217;s not, he thinks, love, but it will work. &nbsp; Dominic has his faults but I really liked his character. He is known for his temper (he bellows in the House of Lords) but I like that he owns up to his mistakes. He’ll say the wrong thing and accidentally insult someone but then realizes it immediately and apologizes. I found him appealing and, regularly, funny. &nbsp; Torie is one of my favorite historical heroines. Society dismisses her because she can&#8217;t read&#8211;the reader realizes she&#8217;s dyslexic&#8211;but Dominic sees how smart she really is and how joyful she is, no matter how much the world knocks her down.

                "html": "<p>In this dual timeline contemporary romance, we follow the lives of Luke, the world’s hottest surfer, and Juliet, a beautiful woman ostensibly characterized as a musician. This label feels tenuous at best, as the narrative divulges virtually nothing about her career, her music, or her perception of fame. Juliet&#8217;s primary role seems to be that of the romantic heroine, her identity revolving around her love for the hero. (I think this is the current take on hero centric romance: the heroine exists just to bask in the excellence of the object of her love/lust.) Their love story is complicated by an insurmountable barrier related to the death of Danny, Luke’s best friend from college. Which is frustrating because the friendship between Danny and Luke is puzzling: Danny is depicted as a self-absorbed man-child, while Luke is a hyper-masculine figure capable of seeing Juliet&#8217;s true self. I couldn&#8217;t see the problem.</p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m getting ahead of myself.</p>\n<p>The story kicks off in the present day, where Juliet and Luke have returned to the small town Juliet and Danny hailed from. They’re collaborating with Danny’s mother to open a home for foster kids, a project funded by all the money Juliet and Luke have earned from their very successful careers. We quickly learn the two haven’t seen each other since Danny&#8217;s death seven years prior and, whoa, is there a bunch of unresolved sh*t between them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Why? Well, ten years ago, after his first year in college, Danny brought his best bud&#8211;again, no clue why they are friends&#8211;Luke home for the summer to stay with his very Christian parents, and Juliet, whom they took in after she ran away from her abusive family. Danny’s father, a pastor, is a judgmental figure who tolerates Juliet’s presence but constantly reminds her that she’s there on sufferance. His mother, Donna, is a misguided gem. Danny and Juliet are dating, and Danny, his parents, and all the townsfolk assume that Danny will someday be the pastor, with Juliet his subservient wife.</p>\n<p>Juliet is not enthusiastic about this life. She dreams of being a singer-songwriter, a passion she can&#8217;t pursue in the constraining environment Danny’s family offers. (But she&#8217;s so grateful to them for taking her in that she can&#8217;t rebel because it would be hurtful. Sigh.) Plus, she loves Danny or so she thinks she does&#8230; until the moment she meets Luke.</p>\n<p>Luke, who is big, tall, strong, gorgeous, given to five words sentences and few smiles, makes her lady parts hum and her stomach flip. This makes sense, given that Danny doesn&#8217;t believe in any pre-marital hanky panky. He is a virgin. Juliet is not&#8211;she was forced into sex with her much older step-brother when she was a teen. This abuse complicates matters; she’s experienced sex as both a pleasurable and painful act. O&#8217;Roark writes Juliet’s ambivalence and trauma with nuance and, in doing so, makes Juliet&#8217;s often self-destructive behavior understandable but she still drove me crazy.</p>\n<p>We know almost nothing about how Luke feels&#8211;I mean, obviously he&#8217;s been in love with Juliet since day one&#8211;because the book is all told from Juliet&#8217;s point of view. This isn&#8217;t great&#8211;she&#8217;s a giant martyr and isn&#8217;t one to share anything non-Danny or non-Luke related. I still have no idea how successful she is as a musician, what she thinks about her work, or what her favorite song is. I do know that Luke is a world famous surfer who beats up anyone who is or has been a threat to Juliet. He also looks amazing naked.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: var(--global-body-font-family);\">The narrative oscillates between the present, where Juliet and Luke’s unspoken history brims with tension, and the past, where readers anticipate their inevitable affair. The predictable plot structure becomes frustrating as not much happens. In both timelines, Luke and Juliet are stupid in lust with one another&#8211;this book has some serious sexual tension&#8211;and most readers will be flipping the pages ready for the two to finally jump each other&#8217;s bones. We do know that Juliet feels guilty about Danny&#8217;s death and Luke does not. Why that is, the reader must wait until the very end to find out. (It was not worth the wait.)&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>Despite these criticisms, I enjoyed reading this book. O’Rourke’s talent for crafting voices and memorable characters shines through. Their circle of friends, Danny&#8217;s complex relationship with his parents, and the awful childhoods Luke and Juliet experienced are all believable and compelling. The love scenes are intensely passionate&#8211;O’Rourke writes steamy sex fabulously. The angst in the book isn&#8217;t super deep but it&#8217;s real enough to make <strong>The Summer We Fell</strong> more than just fun froth.</p>\n<p>The book <strong>is</strong> sexy and fun and O’Rourke’s skill with dialogue and character creation is evident&#8211;I get why her work is popular. However, this particular book feels like a missed opportunity, with an underdeveloped heroine and a plot that doesn’t surprise. This makes it a B/B- read.</p>\n",

Well, ten years ago, after his first year in college, Danny brought his best bud&#8211;again, no clue why they are friends&#8211;Luke home for the summer to stay with his very Christian parents, and Juliet, whom they took in after she ran away from her abusive family. Danny’s father, a pastor, is a judgmental figure who tolerates Juliet’s presence but constantly reminds her that she’s there on sufferance. His mother, Donna, is a misguided gem. Danny and Juliet are dating, and Danny, his parents, and all the townsfolk assume that Danny will someday be the pastor, with Juliet his subservient wife. Juliet is not enthusiastic about this life. She dreams of being a singer-songwriter, a passion she can&#8217;t pursue in the constraining environment Danny’s family offers. (But she&#8217;s so grateful to them for taking her in that she can&#8217;t rebel because it would be hurtful. Sigh.) Plus, she loves Danny or so she thinks she does&#8230; until the moment she meets Luke. Luke, who is big, tall, strong, gorgeous, given to five words sentences and few smiles, makes her lady parts hum and her stomach flip. This makes sense, given that Danny doesn&#8217;t believe in any pre-marital hanky panky. He is a virgin. Juliet is not&#8211;she was forced into sex with her much older step-brother when she was a teen. This abuse complicates matters; she’s experienced sex as both a pleasurable and painful act. O&#8217;Roark writes Juliet’s ambivalence and trauma with nuance and, in doing so, makes Juliet&#8217;s often self-destructive behavior understandable but she still drove me crazy. We know almost nothing about how Luke feels&#8211;I mean, obviously he&#8217;s been in love with Juliet since day one&#8211;because the book is all told from Juliet&#8217;s point of view. This isn&#8217;t great&#8211;she&#8217;s a giant martyr and isn&#8217;t one to share anything non-Danny or non-Luke related. I still have no idea how successful she is as a musician, what she thinks about her work, or what her favorite song is. I do know that Luke is a world famous surfer who beats up anyone who is or has been a threat to Juliet. He also looks amazing naked. The narrative oscillates between the present, where Juliet and Luke’s unspoken history brims with tension, and the past, where readers anticipate their inevitable affair. The predictable plot structure becomes frustrating as not much happens. In both timelines, Luke and Juliet are stupid in lust with one another&#8211;this book has some serious sexual tension&#8211;and most readers will be flipping the pages ready for the two to finally jump each other&#8217;s bones. We do know that Juliet feels guilty about Danny&#8217;s death and Luke does not. Why that is, the reader must wait until the very end to find out. (It was not worth the wait.)&nbsp; Despite these criticisms, I enjoyed reading this book. O’Rourke’s talent for crafting voices and memorable characters shines through. Their circle of friends, Danny&#8217;s complex relationship with his parents, and the awful childhoods Luke and Juliet experienced are all believable and compelling. The love scenes are intensely passionate&#8211;O’Rourke writes steamy sex fabulously. The angst in the book isn&#8217;t super deep but it&#8217;s real enough to make The Summer We Fell more than just fun froth. The book is sexy and fun and O’Rourke’s skill with dialogue and character creation is evident&#8211;I get why her work is popular. However, this particular book feels like a missed opportunity, with an underdeveloped heroine and a plot that doesn’t surprise. This makes it a B/B- read."

When I finished it, I thought, Crouch is gunning for Harlan Coben&#8217;s audience and she&#8217;s done a very good job. Like many of Coben&#8217;s stand alone thrillers, Middletide is, at its dark(ish) heart, a love story.

That said, <strong>Middletide</strong> is a worthwhile read.</p>\n<p>The book opens on a cold morning in 1994 with two fishermen finding a hanging body on the shores of Puget Sound. The corpse is that of the preternaturally beautiful Erin Landy, the main doctor in the small town of Point Orchards.

Then we are in 1977, then 1992, then 1994, then 1992 again&#8211;the book zigs back and forth through time, slowly setting out the context of the relationships between Nakita, Elijah, and Erin.</p>\n<p>This is a novel that lays its conceits out slowly. Early on, we know that Elijah, despite promising to return to Nakita in 1977, did not. He spent ten years in California, writing <strong>Middletide</strong>, his first great novel. The novel was a flop due to a single negative review from the ubiquitous <em>New York</em> <em>Times</em> and Elijah, out of money and ashamed, slunk home in 1992. He began rehabbing the cabin he&#8217;d grown up in while earning a living working in his dead father&#8217;s best friend&#8217;s&#8211;Chitto&#8211;garage. He longs to connect again with Nakita who is in mourning for her husband of five years who was killed in a hunting accident. For her part, Erin is still devastated from the loss of her young daughter who was recently killed in a car accident.</p>\n<p>Crouch leisurely takes us through Elijah&#8217;s life in Point Orchards. When he is not learning how to live off his land, he is trying to get Nakita back and, I must confess, for much of the book, his thoughts about her veered towards the borderline obsessive. We spend a lot of time sharing Elijah&#8217;s thoughts, as well as those of Erin and Nakita. We get hints about what their lives look like when the murder occurs but stlll, at well the novel&#8217;s midpoint, I had no idea how the three were, in 1994, connected.</p>\n<p>Then, a discovery is made and it is suddenly blindingly clear who killed Erin but only to the reader. The cops are remarkably credulous until they are not and I found their behavior to be frustrating. The last quarter of the novel moves at breakneck speed and the story&#8217;s resolution is more or less satisfying.</p>\n<p>Crouch is a strong writer, especially about the land and her unusual timeline gives the book an intellectual interest the plot doesn&#8217;t quite match. The characterizations of Nakita and Erin aren&#8217;t especially nuanced and, though Elijah is clearly limned, I wasn&#8217;t crazy about him as a person. He&#8217;s one of those leads that&#8217;s interesting to read about but not especially endearing.</p>\n<p>But I did, overall, enjoy the book. The mystery, for much of the novel, is slippery and the story doesn&#8217;t feel any need to demonize any of its characters. This is, oddly enough, a feel good story, with a resolution Coben would cheer. I&#8217;ll definitely be reading whatever Crouch writes next and, if you like unusually plotted literary mysteries, you&#8217;ll enjoy the time you spend reading <strong>Middletide</strong>.</p>\n",

He longs to connect again with Nakita who is in mourning for her husband of five years who was killed in a hunting accident. For her part, Erin is still devastated from the loss of her young daughter who was recently killed in a car accident. Crouch leisurely takes us through Elijah&#8217;s life in Point Orchards. When he is not learning how to live off his land, he is trying to get Nakita back and, I must confess, for much of the book, his thoughts about her veered towards the borderline obsessive. We spend a lot of time sharing Elijah&#8217;s thoughts, as well as those of Erin and Nakita. We get hints about what their lives look like when the murder occurs but stlll, at well the novel&#8217;s midpoint, I had no idea how the three were, in 1994, connected. Then, a discovery is made and it is suddenly blindingly clear who killed Erin but only to the reader. The cops are remarkably credulous until they are not and I found their behavior to be frustrating. The last quarter of the novel moves at breakneck speed and the story&#8217;s resolution is more or less satisfying. Crouch is a strong writer, especially about the land and her unusual timeline gives the book an intellectual interest the plot doesn&#8217;t quite match. The characterizations of Nakita and Erin aren&#8217;t especially nuanced and, though Elijah is clearly limned, I wasn&#8217;t crazy about him as a person. He&#8217;s one of those leads that&#8217;s interesting to read about but not especially endearing. But I did, overall, enjoy the book. The mystery, for much of the novel, is slippery and the story doesn&#8217;t feel any need to demonize any of its characters. This is, oddly enough, a feel good story, with a resolution Coben would cheer. I&#8217;ll definitely be reading whatever Crouch writes next and, if you like unusually plotted literary mysteries, you&#8217;ll enjoy the time you spend reading Middletide."

                "html": "<div>\n<p><strong>Dabney: </strong>Look on the Bright Side is the third book Higgins has set in the Cape Cod town of Wellfleet&#8211;the others are <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/a-little-ray-of-sunshine-by-kristan-higgins/\"><strong>A Little Ray of Sunshine</strong></a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/out-of-the-clear-blue-sky-by-kristan-higgins/\"><strong>Out of the Clear Blue Sky</strong></a>&#8211;and it is my favorite of the series.</p>\n<p>The main lead&#8211;although there are three women whose lives we follow&#8211;is Lark Smith, the younger sister of the Harlow, whose story was told in <strong>A Little Ray of Sunshine</strong>. In the early pages of the book, Lark didn&#8217;t wow me&#8211;she is initially sunshiny to the point of treacle and that rarely works for me.</p>\n<p>Lark, however, like this book, grew on me.</p>\n<p>As the story begins, Lark&#8217;s boss in Oncology is booting her down to the ER because she keeps crying around patients. This is NOT what Lark wants because, for many years, she has believed she is destined become an oncologist. But he is adamant, and Lark is sent to work in the ER for six weeks. (This is not how residencies work but it doesn&#8217;t really matter so I&#8217;ve decided to let it go.)</p>\n<p>That same day, she gets a text from one of the hospital&#8217;s most famous surgeons, Lorenzo Santini whom everyone calls Dr. Satan&#8211;he is known as an interpersonal nightmare. She has no idea what he wants but agrees to meet him as he asks. For reasons&#8211;and again, I just decided to go with this even though it is impossible to believe this would happen in the real medical world&#8211;he wants her to be his date for the summer because his grandmother, who is dying, wants to know he is happily partnered. In exchange, he’ll put in a good word for Lark with some high-flying cancer docs he knows. Even though she thinks it&#8217;s a bit scuzzy&#8211;me too, Lark, me too&#8211;she agrees.</p>\n<p>Honestly, the first few chapters of this book had me shaking my head. Lark is a manic pixie girl, Lorenzo is a caricature of a brilliant asshole surgeon, and I struggled to feel OK about the fact that Lark&#8217;s true love, Justin, has been dead for seven years&#8211;she&#8217;s 33&#8211;and she&#8217;s never come close to getting over him. I thought about DNF-ing the book.</p>\n<p>I am so happy I didn&#8217;t. <strong>Look on the Bright Side</strong> is&#8211;and this is saying something&#8211;one of Higgin&#8217;s bests.</p>\n<p>Kayne, what are your thoughts?</p>\n<p><strong>Kayne:</strong> I really liked Lark! She has a sense of humor and is so kind to everyone. She is funny on her first date with Lorenzo when we see her thinking how stuffy and arrogant he is yet she’s trying to be polite but is a little snarky and orders all the most expensive things on the menu. I wondered if this was going to be a grumpy/sunshine trope and it became even more interesting when Lark meets Dante, Lorenzo’s hot, firefighter brother. I couldn’t wait to find out who she would end up with. Was Lorenzo as big of a jerk as he first appeared, or would he redeem himself? Is Dante as nice of a guy as he seems and if so, what will he think of Lark after he finds out she’s been fake dating Lorenzo?</p>\n<p>I agree Lark was over the top when she kept crying in Oncology and while it didn’t bother me as much that she was still grieving for Justin, I wasn’t interested in hearing about their courtship and how much she missed him – I wanted to skip to the part where she falls in love again. I wanted to know how her dates were going with Lorenzo’s family and if she could make it in ER.</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney:</strong> I get the whole love of my life thing, I do. But I also felt as though it was past time for Lark to move on. It was fun to watch her with both Dante and Lorenzo&#8211;and I liked the way both storylines played out. But I was very ready to get out of Lark&#8217;s head and thus was thrilled when, in chapter four, the narration shifts from Lark to her mom Ellie. From that point, the book began to soar.</p>\n<p>Unlike her daughter, Ellie is not a ball of sweetness and light, especially not after she discovers her devoted husband of 38 years, has done something she finds almost unforgivable. This comes as a shock to her and to everyone in their town because she and Gerald have what just about everyone would describe as the best marriage ever. They&#8217;re madly in love, have a hot sex life, adore their five kids and three grandkids, have their health, and Ellie has a very successful career as a painter and gallery owner. But now, now Ellie suddenly sees her life through the lens of anger. She&#8217;s supporting their family while Gerald faffs about starting and never finishing projects at home AND HE&#8217;S RETIRED! She is so angry she, rather randomly, moves out of the home they&#8217;ve lived in forever and in with Joy, a wealthy, lonely woman who moved to Wellfleet several years ago and is still mourning the death of her best friend and brother.</p>\n<p>What did you think about Ellie and her story?</p>\n<p><strong>Kayne:</strong> I couldn&#8217;t wait to find out if Ellie would go back to Gerald. I was glad to see her take the summer off for herself, not just because of what happened with Gerald but because she had worked so many years without a break and she deserved one. I admired Ellie and her relationships with her family. It was interesting to see how her paintings changed over the summer.</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney:</strong> Ellie is my jam. I was less interested in Joy. What are your thoughts about her?</p>\n<p><strong>Kayne:</strong> I loved Joy &#8211; her name fit her so well because she brought joy to everyone she meets. She was such a good friend to Lark and her mom, Ellie, the way she took them in and how they all helped each other heal. It was special when she started working at the Bayview Senior Living Community in the Memory Care Unit and her classes were such a big hit, everyone started taking them, not just the memory residents. Hearing about her classes, like Joyful Movement, made me smile &#8211; I wanted to take them too.</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney:</strong> Though&nbsp;Joy&#8217;s story didn&#8217;t do much for me, I loved Ellie&#8217;s and, after the first quarter of the book, I fell for Lark&#8217;s as well. But what I love most about this book&#8211;which moved me to tears more than once&#8211;is that Higgins writes gorgeously about the startling joy life offers when we have made our peace with death.</p>\n<p>Lark, as part of trying to get back to oncology, becomes a hospice volunteer and the parts of the story where she sits with those who are dying are phenomenal.

                "text": "Dabney: Look on the Bright Side is the third book Higgins has set in the Cape Cod town of Wellfleet&#8211;the others are A Little Ray of Sunshine&nbsp;and Out of the Clear Blue Sky&#8211;and it is my favorite of the series. The main lead&#8211;although there are three women whose lives we follow&#8211;is Lark Smith, the younger sister of the Harlow, whose story was told in A Little Ray of Sunshine. In the early pages of the book, Lark didn&#8217;t wow me&#8211;she is initially sunshiny to the point of treacle and that rarely works for me. Lark, however, like this book, grew on me. As the story begins, Lark&#8217;s boss in Oncology is booting her down to the ER because she keeps crying around patients. This is NOT what Lark wants because, for many years, she has believed she is destined become an oncologist. But he is adamant, and Lark is sent to work in the ER for six weeks. (This is not how residencies work but it doesn&#8217;t really matter so I&#8217;ve decided to let it go.) That same day, she gets a text from one of the hospital&#8217;s most famous surgeons, Lorenzo Santini whom everyone calls Dr. Satan&#8211;he is known as an interpersonal nightmare. She has no idea what he wants but agrees to meet him as he asks. For reasons&#8211;and again, I just decided to go with this even though it is impossible to believe this would happen in the real medical world&#8211;he wants her to be his date for the summer because his grandmother, who is dying, wants to know he is happily partnered. In exchange, he’ll put in a good word for Lark with some high-flying cancer docs he knows. Even though she thinks it&#8217;s a bit scuzzy&#8211;me too, Lark, me too&#8211;she agrees. Honestly, the first few chapters of this book had me shaking my head. Lark is a manic pixie girl, Lorenzo is a caricature of a brilliant asshole surgeon, and I struggled to feel OK about the fact that Lark&#8217;s true love, Justin, has been dead for seven years&#8211;she&#8217;s 33&#8211;and she&#8217;s never come close to getting over him. I thought about DNF-ing the book. I am so happy I didn&#8217;t. Look on the Bright Side is&#8211;and this is saying something&#8211;one of Higgin&#8217;s bests. Kayne, what are your thoughts? Kayne: I really liked Lark! She has a sense of humor and is so kind to everyone. She is funny on her first date with Lorenzo when we see her thinking how stuffy and arrogant he is yet she’s trying to be polite but is a little snarky and orders all the most expensive things on the menu. I wondered if this was going to be a grumpy/sunshine trope and it became even more interesting when Lark meets Dante, Lorenzo’s hot, firefighter brother. I couldn’t wait to find out who she would end up with. Was Lorenzo as big of a jerk as he first appeared, or would he redeem himself? Is Dante as nice of a guy as he seems and if so, what will he think of Lark after he finds out she’s been fake dating Lorenzo? I agree Lark was over the top when she kept crying in Oncology and while it didn’t bother me as much that she was still grieving for Justin, I wasn’t interested in hearing about their courtship and how much she missed him – I wanted to skip to the part where she falls in love again. I wanted to know how her dates were going with Lorenzo’s family and if she could make it in ER. Dabney: I get the whole love of my life thing, I do. But I also felt as though it was past time for Lark to move on. It was fun to watch her with both Dante and Lorenzo&#8211;and I liked the way both storylines played out. But I was very ready to get out of Lark&#8217;s head and thus was thrilled when, in chapter four, the narration shifts from Lark to her mom Ellie. From that point, the book began to soar. Unlike her daughter, Ellie is not a ball of sweetness and light, especially not after she discovers her devoted husband of 38 years, has done something she finds almost unforgivable. This comes as a shock to her and to everyone in their town because she and Gerald have what just about everyone would describe as the best marriage ever. They&#8217;re madly in love, have a hot sex life, adore their five kids and three grandkids, have their health, and Ellie has a very successful career as a painter and gallery owner. But now, now Ellie suddenly sees her life through the lens of anger. She&#8217;s supporting their family while Gerald faffs about starting and never finishing projects at home AND HE&#8217;S RETIRED! She is so angry she, rather randomly, moves out of the home they&#8217;ve lived in forever and in with Joy, a wealthy, lonely woman who moved to Wellfleet several years ago and is still mourning the death of her best friend and brother. What did you think about Ellie and her story? Kayne: I couldn&#8217;t wait to find out if Ellie would go back to Gerald. I was glad to see her take the summer off for herself, not just because of what happened with Gerald but because she had worked so many years without a break and she deserved one. I admired Ellie and her relationships with her family. It was interesting to see how her paintings changed over the summer. Dabney: Ellie is my jam. I was less interested in Joy. What are your thoughts about her? Kayne: I loved Joy &#8211; her name fit her so well because she brought joy to everyone she meets. She was such a good friend to Lark and her mom, Ellie, the way she took them in and how they all helped each other heal. It was special when she started working at the Bayview Senior Living Community in the Memory Care Unit and her classes were such a big hit, everyone started taking them, not just the memory residents. Hearing about her classes, like Joyful Movement, made me smile &#8211; I wanted to take them too. Dabney: Though&nbsp;Joy&#8217;s story didn&#8217;t do much for me, I loved Ellie&#8217;s and, after the first quarter of the book, I fell for Lark&#8217;s as well. But what I love most about this book&#8211;which moved me to tears more than once&#8211;is that Higgins writes gorgeously about the startling joy life offers when we have made our peace with death. Lark, as part of trying to get back to oncology, becomes a hospice volunteer and the parts of the story where she sits with those who are dying are phenomenal. Higgins&#8217; greatest gift in all her books is her risible love for humanity paired with her determination to give her readers genuine hope about life, love, and the world. The key word there, and why this book ended up being so lovely, is genuine. In Look on the Bright Side, Higgins leans into death.

I had a hard time buying that Roxie, just because she&#8217;s tall and brunette, could only find men interested in only hooking up.</p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m ancient. Lisa, am I missing something here?</p>\n<p><b>Lisa: </b>Well, they&#8217;d gladly do the same thing to Ms. Sweeney &#8211; trust me, I know of men who are the types of dudes who would do what they do with Roxie but ply their wares upon young blondes.  Yeah, that&#8217;s a small blemish on the books&#8217; credibility.</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney:</strong> The thing is, except when she was being an idiot, I really liked Roxie. She&#8217;s smart, very good at her job, has a wickedly sharp sense of humor, and, in general, is one of those people you meet in a book that you&#8217;d totally like to grab a drink with. What did you think of her?</p>\n<p><b>Lisa: </b>Honestly, she&#8217;s probably my favorite romance heroine of the year so far because of all of those things.</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney:</strong> I also liked Chris. I&#8217;d be happy if my kid brought him home as a friend or a date. He&#8217;s smart, full of zingy quips, and is cleary deeply loyal to those he cares for. I liked him so much that, when Roxie refused to cut him slack for any of his missteps, I thought she was being overly extra.</p>\n<p><b>Lisa: </b>Chris is smart, normal and super fun &#8211; definitely an excellent hero.</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney:</strong> This is certainly, for a book that is less than 225 pages long, chockablock full of sex, all of which involves Roxie. She has sex with four different guys and all of the scenes are <em>detailed</em>. Which is fine because Ember writes excellent sex scenes. And, props to her given her dedication to writing Roxie the rake&#8217;s many hookups judgement free, she manages to show that, when it&#8217;s sex and love, it&#8217;s a different and better kind of sex.</p>\n<p><b>Lisa: </b>Oh yeah, this one borders on a hot rating for a reason. And I liked the detached fondness of all the hookup sex versus what happens with Chris, which feels more real, so to speak.</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney:</strong> My biggest complaint is, especially given how short this book is, Roxie&#8217;s insistence on HAVING THINGS HER WAY ONLY. Chris was clearly deserving of her trust, love, and great blow jobs&#8211;I got a bit bored of the endless stream of NO Roxie defaulted to.</p>\n<p><b>Lisa:</b> I found it more psychologically complex; she was clearly punishing herself here.</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney:</strong> I think I needed more words to understand that Roxie was complex as opposed to unnecessarily self-destructive. That said, I suspect she&#8217;s a heroine that will resonate with many.</p>\n<p>This is a very modern romance and I liked that about it. I&#8217;m here for a romance novel&#8217;s casual sex enthusiast being female. Once Roxie opened up her heart a bit, the power dynamic in the book seemed fab and fair. The sex scenes are focused on female and male pleasure in erotic and realistic ways. Those who are willing to forgo traditional assumptions about women looking for some good D rather than love will find Roxie and Chris&#8217; story appealing.</p>\n<p><b>Lisa: </b>If it breaks down the walls surrounding stigma attached to romancelandia slut shaming, I&#8217;m all for it.</p>\n<p><b>Dabney:</b> It&#8217;s a B read for me. Roxie took too long to let herself fall for very kind Chris and the book seemed padded with more sex than plot. But, overall, it&#8217;s a fun, sexy read.</p>\n<p><b>Lisa</b>: Going a little higher with a B+ because I really liked hero and Heroine alike &#8211; the sex was enjoyable and I can&#8217;t complain that too much was enough.</p>\n",

And I have to say I found the whole men like to bang Roxie but not seriously date her because she isn&#8217;t small and blonde a bit much. I&#8217;d hazard that the same men who seek Sydney Sweeney look alikes to be their OTP are equally DTF same. I had a hard time buying that Roxie, just because she&#8217;s tall and brunette, could only find men interested in only hooking up. But I&#8217;m ancient. Lisa, am I missing something here? Lisa: Well, they&#8217;d gladly do the same thing to Ms. Sweeney &#8211; trust me, I know of men who are the types of dudes who would do what they do with Roxie but ply their wares upon young blondes.  Yeah, that&#8217;s a small blemish on the books&#8217; credibility. Dabney: The thing is, except when she was being an idiot, I really liked Roxie. She&#8217;s smart, very good at her job, has a wickedly sharp sense of humor, and, in general, is one of those people you meet in a book that you&#8217;d totally like to grab a drink with. What did you think of her? Lisa: Honestly, she&#8217;s probably my favorite romance heroine of the year so far because of all of those things. Dabney: I also liked Chris. I&#8217;d be happy if my kid brought him home as a friend or a date. He&#8217;s smart, full of zingy quips, and is cleary deeply loyal to those he cares for. I liked him so much that, when Roxie refused to cut him slack for any of his missteps, I thought she was being overly extra. Lisa: Chris is smart, normal and super fun &#8211; definitely an excellent hero. Dabney: This is certainly, for a book that is less than 225 pages long, chockablock full of sex, all of which involves Roxie. She has sex with four different guys and all of the scenes are detailed. Which is fine because Ember writes excellent sex scenes. And, props to her given her dedication to writing Roxie the rake&#8217;s many hookups judgement free, she manages to show that, when it&#8217;s sex and love, it&#8217;s a different and better kind of sex. Lisa: Oh yeah, this one borders on a hot rating for a reason. And I liked the detached fondness of all the hookup sex versus what happens with Chris, which feels more real, so to speak. Dabney: My biggest complaint is, especially given how short this book is, Roxie&#8217;s insistence on HAVING THINGS HER WAY ONLY. Chris was clearly deserving of her trust, love, and great blow jobs&#8211;I got a bit bored of the endless stream of NO Roxie defaulted to. Lisa: I found it more psychologically complex; she was clearly punishing herself here. Dabney: I think I needed more words to understand that Roxie was complex as opposed to unnecessarily self-destructive. That said, I suspect she&#8217;s a heroine that will resonate with many. This is a very modern romance and I liked that about it. I&#8217;m here for a romance novel&#8217;s casual sex enthusiast being female. Once Roxie opened up her heart a bit, the power dynamic in the book seemed fab and fair. The sex scenes are focused on female and male pleasure in erotic and realistic ways. Those who are willing to forgo traditional assumptions about women looking for some good D rather than love will find Roxie and Chris&#8217; story appealing. Lisa: If it breaks down the walls surrounding stigma attached to romancelandia slut shaming, I&#8217;m all for it. Dabney: It&#8217;s a B read for me. Roxie took too long to let herself fall for very kind Chris and the book seemed padded with more sex than plot. But, overall, it&#8217;s a fun, sexy read. Lisa: Going a little higher with a B+ because I really liked hero and Heroine alike &#8211; the sex was enjoyable and I can&#8217;t complain that too much was enough."

After first being seen as a victim, Lucy slowly became the town&#8217;s prime suspect&#8211;even her parents seem to think she might be a murderess. There wasn&#8217;t enough evidence to convict Lucy or, for that matter, anyone, and Savannah&#8217;s murder remains unsolved. Lucy bolted to Los Angeles, rebooted her identity, and, under a pen name, became a successful romance writer. Now, she&#8217;s living under the radar with with a stodgy boyfriend when her anonymity suddenly vanishes thanks to a new viral podcast called <em>Listen for the Lie</em> featuring investigative fame seeker Ben Owens. Ben&#8217;s latest subject?

                "text": "Five years ago, in the gleefully gossipy small town of Plumpton, Texas, Lucy Chase wandered out of the woods, covered in blood, unable to recall who killed her best friend Savannah. After first being seen as a victim, Lucy slowly became the town&#8217;s prime suspect&#8211;even her parents seem to think she might be a murderess. There wasn&#8217;t enough evidence to convict Lucy or, for that matter, anyone, and Savannah&#8217;s murder remains unsolved. Lucy bolted to Los Angeles, rebooted her identity, and, under a pen name, became a successful romance writer. Now, she&#8217;s living under the radar with with a stodgy boyfriend when her anonymity suddenly vanishes thanks to a new viral podcast called Listen for the Lie featuring investigative fame seeker Ben Owens. Ben&#8217;s latest subject? Savanah&#8217;s unsolved murder. Even though she thinks it&#8217;s probably a very bad idea, Lucy returns, reluctantly, to Plumpton to celebrate her grandmother&#8217;s Beverley&#8217;s 80th birthday.

Greenlaw&#8217;s storytelling relies not on dragons or complicated magic but rather on Mira, her riveting heroine, and those on whom she must rely. Lisa, was it a gem for you too?</p>\n<p><strong>Lisa:</strong> This was my first encounter with this author and I was mightily impressed by it. Mira is a stunner of a character; and she happens to be one of the best of 2024. She’s something special and unique in the field.</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney:</strong> Agreed. The very best leads in magical fiction are those whose magic is a plus not a necessity. I’d have happily read about Mira if she hadn’t an enchanted bone in her body–she’s smart, a bit snarky, determined, loyal, and witty. I loved her.</p>\n<p>Mira, as we learn in the first pages of the novel, lives in a small, coastal town that relies on the illegal goods they get from being wreckers. She has a preternatural ability to stay in the water and the villagers use her to swim out to the wrecked ships and bring back treasures. She is both ambivalent and determined about her work–she is a marvelously pragmatic woman. When the wrecking goes terribly wrong and her father is imprisoned by the draconian British Guard, she sets out on a quest and, oh, I was so there to watch her in all her adventures.</p>\n<p><strong>Lisa:</strong> The piratical worldbuilding here is fantastic; it reminded me of several different real-life subcultures, like people who scavenge wrecks for cash, or pearl divers working in the deep sea to support their villages. It felt very real and lived-in. And Mira’s love of the ocean is gorgeous and well-defined. It’s, in a great way, a definite part of who she is.</p>\n<p>Now, we both loved Mira, but what did you think of Seth? He was wonderful in my opinion &#8211; at least in the beginning…</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney:</strong> Seth, like many a good romantic hero, is full of surprises. I liked his ambiguity–one of the reasons to keep turning the pages in this very good book is to see if he is truly an ally or not. What did you so like about him?</p>\n<p><strong>Lisa:</strong> He had some great lines, and his mysterious ways kept me turning the pages, TBH. But…well, let’s just say that wonderfulness gets complicated with time and ends with a big twist we won’t spoil here. The ending of this novel leaves things in a very…cliffhangy place. That said, moral grayness is a wonderful part of this novel, and it is a feature and not a bug.</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney:</strong> I so agree with you about the way the book treats good and evil. Greenlaw knows that while her characters all have the capacity to do right and wrong, they, like us all, rarely choose one or the other. I loved the people in this book–they are utterly believable. Seth, Mira, her friends, and those they meet on their journey are wonderfully limned.</p>\n<p><strong>Lisa:</strong> Her ability to paint her characters as real, live human beings is what makes this book so very compelling, to be honest.</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: To me, a great book has a trifecta of offerings; the best novels have stellar characters, engrossing plots, and wonderful worldbuilding. We’ve agreed that the characterizations in <strong>Compass and Blade</strong> are excellent. What did you think about the plot?</p>\n<p><strong>Lisa:</strong> The plot is fantastic, even if it’s your typical protagonist-finds-self-while-looking-for-lost-parent journey. It’s powerfully done, quite suspenseful and yes &#8211; leaves room for a sequel (this is set to be a trilogy).</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney:</strong> Well, it is an oft quoted maxim that there are only seven stories humans tell–I am rarely critical of novels simply because they recount stories we’ve read before. What I care about is how well is that tale told and, in <strong>Compass and Blade</strong>, I think it’s done beautifully. The details of this story–Mira’s experiences in and out of the sea, the battles she and her compatriots are drawn into, the politics of the worlds she travels to–these are all unique and made for a page turner of a book.</p>\n<p><strong>Lisa:</strong> Completely true. The world of sailing here is beautifully, written and sculpted thoughtfully. Did it encourage you to think of heading out on a boat yourself?</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney:</strong> I love being on the water but I think I’d like it a lot better if I had Mira’s gifts!</p>\n<p><strong>Lisa:</strong> I can’t blame you, but it made me want to check out the high seas. Familial loyalty is also important here; after all, Mira’s journey is all about rescuing her father. What did you think about the themes of family and family ties binding in this one?</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney:</strong> If I have a complaint about the book, it’s the bloody-mindedness of Mira’s determination to save her father. Parents, in the overwhelming main, never want their kids to sacrifice their lives for them. I wanted Mira to value her life as much as she does her dad’s.</p>\n<p><strong>Lisa:</strong> I actually related to that part of the story. Maybe because my mom’s dead and my father’s very much a part of my life, but I could understand her need to get sacrificial.</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney:</strong> Huh. I think for me, it’s probably an age thing. I can’t imagine the horror I’d feel if one of my kids or my siblings’ kids gave up their life for mine. That said, it certainly makes Mira an admirable character.

                "html": "<p>This novella takes readers on a journey through the rocky marriage of Mara and Ambrose, Duke and Duchess of Southwick. With a fair amount of old-school storytelling and plenty of steamy moments, the story revolves around a troubled marriage in need of healing. I read it in an evening and can say it&#8217;s&#8230; fine. Too short and the storyline doesn&#8217;t really make sense but if you&#8217;re looking for throwback romance, Eaton is here for you.</p>\n<p>It does, however, get off to an awful start.</p>\n<p>Three gossipy ladies of the ton are at the dressmaker&#8217;s and, whew, are they cattily portrayed. One is large and loud, the other flat-chested and obsessed with cats. The third has breasts ruined by time and six kids. They&#8217;re unimaginatively named: Lady Harmsworth, Lady Topple, and Lady Farthing. Lady Harmsworth shares the gossip that the reclusive Lady Southwick&#8211;she has not been to town since her wedding eighteen months ago&#8211;has decided to come to town and take a lover. The three women are just so meanly portrayed and I&#8217;m pretty sure the modes of address&#8211;and, really, I don&#8217;t care about this&#8211;are incorrect. But, thankfully, once we leave the three busybodies, the book becomes much better.</p>\n<p>This rumor, of course, quickly reaches Adrian, the Duke of Southerland at his club. And though Adrian acts bored by this news&#8211;he&#8217;s dickish enough to say he wishes whomever could get in his ice cold wife&#8217;s bed good luck&#8211;he is anything but. His internal response can be summed up by three words: <em>No fucking way</em>.</p>\n<p>Next we meet the very nice Mara who, when we meet her, is gardening at Southwick Castle, the estate her husband dumped her in after a disastrous wedding night. Mara learns of the rumor sweeping London from her sister Kitty who comes to ask her sister &#8220;what the hell?&#8221; Mara explains that she does want to take a lover but in turns out she was thinking lover could mean companion. Her one experience with the marital bed was so dreadful she sure doesn&#8217;t want to do THAT again. No, Mara, is tired of her lonely existence in the country estate and wants <em>companionship. </em>Kitty, wonderfully brash and fearless, tells her she&#8217;s out of her mind. She&#8217;s duchess for god&#8217;s sake and she&#8217;s shy and likes to follow the rules. Cheating, even if she&#8217;s not looking for sex, is out. Mara is undeterred. She thinks&#8211;and the reader doesn&#8217;t blame her&#8211;her husband is a cold, cruel man who doesn&#8217;t give a fig about her. She suspects that he has affairs right and left so why would he care if she did the same.</p>\n<p>She, it turns out, is wrong on both accounts.</p>\n<p>Now, look, you&#8217;ve read this story a million times. Ambrose is DAMAGED from an abusive bad dad childhood. His father taught him, when Ambrose was eight, that caring for anyone is a weakness and DUKES ARE NOT WEAK. Thus, Ambrose has spent his whole life making sure he doesn&#8217;t give a fuck about anyone&#8211;he&#8217;s a big enough jerk to take it a step farther: Cross him and he ruins you. He&#8217;s a man in desperate need of finding his shriveled heart, although having a heart is his worst nightmare. He married Mara because she fit the bill for a duchess and he was sure he&#8217;d never care for her or even, after she conceived his heir, have to see her again. He is emotionally scarred and, though the reader can see why, he is a much bigger dick than most modern historical romance heroes. (I liked this. Sue me.)</p>\n<p>Mara, pre-marriage, was a virgin and she who still doesn&#8217;t understand why the handsome, powerful Duke decided to court and marry her. She and Kitty had an violent father who beat their mother to death. She learned from an early age to fear men. She keeps to herself&#8211;her sister is the beautiful, vivacious one&#8211;and, when she thought about marriage, she just wanted a nice, quiet life with someone who was kind. Instead, she ends up wed to Adrian whom she fell in love with almost immediately because 1) he told her she was pretty and she believed him and 2) the two have <em>we just met sparks</em> that turn into a bonfire the first time they kiss.</p>\n<p>However, despite several passionate embraces before marriage, on their wedding night, Mara just lay there and thought it hurt terribly and Adrian, drunk, stupid, and remarkably clueless and insensitive to the whole virgin thing, botched his part. In the morning&#8211;and you just have to go with it&#8211;he was embarrassed that he&#8217;d done poorly and despite Mara saying&#8211;she really liked all their premarital antics&#8211;she&#8217;d like to try again, he is dismissive, rude, and leaves his marriage. (At one point, before the rumor, he muses to himself that, at some point, he&#8217;ll have to address the whole heir thing but NOT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THAT WOULD INVOLVE FEELINGS. Not to mention an apology.)</p>\n<p>So, here we have a wallpaper historical, a hero who behaves stupidly for REASONS, and a bride who has decided SHE MATTERS. And, if you&#8217;re fine with that set up&#8211;and I am&#8211;this is a fun, hot read. Even though their behavior&#8211;especially his&#8211;doesn&#8217;t make a ton of sense, Mara and Ambrose are very sexy and sweet together. Mara learns to stand up for herself and Ambrose learns his defence mechanisms are ruinous and that, who knew?!?!, love and hot sex with a person you allow yourself to love are THE BOMB. There are lots of swoony love scenes and a fair amount of angst&#8211;the few hours I spent reading this book were mindless fun and, honestly, I am all for fun.</p>\n<p>I am sure there are some historical inaccuracies that will irk AAR&#8217;s historically detail-oriented readers&#8211;again, NOT ME!&#8211;but for those who miss old-skool heroes and heroines whose passions overwhelm them, <strong>The Duchess Takes a Lover</strong> will work. And I am invested in Kitty&#8217;s story&#8211;this book&#8217;s last chapter eases us in to her story which I now want to read.</p>\n<p>Eaton&#8217;s latest isn&#8217;t a stunner but it&#8217;s not bad. If you can get past the slight context, the story is reasonable well-written, the leads engaging, and the sex, hot. I suspect many of its limits are due to its length. Here&#8217;s hoping Kitty&#8217;s story has more heft, literally and figuratively.</p>\n",

I am sure there are some historical inaccuracies that will irk AAR&#8217;s historically detail-oriented readers&#8211;again, NOT ME!&#8211;but for those who miss old-skool heroes and heroines whose passions overwhelm them, The Duchess Takes a Lover will work. And I am invested in Kitty&#8217;s story&#8211;this book&#8217;s last chapter eases us in to her story which I now want to read. Eaton&#8217;s latest isn&#8217;t a stunner but it&#8217;s not bad. If you can get past the slight context, the story is reasonable well-written, the leads engaging, and the sex, hot. I suspect many of its limits are due to its length. Here&#8217;s hoping Kitty&#8217;s story has more heft, literally and figuratively."

Smith is a fearless writer&#8211;her works are violent, gorgeous, and terrifying. She&#8217;s not at all interested in making readers feel good nor does she care to improve us with her prose. She is, first and foremost, a riveting storyteller. It&#8217;s safe to say <strong>Heat</strong> is still a DIK for me and, I suspect, a book that many readers will be appalled by.</p>\n<p>This almost 700 page book intricately weaves together the tales of two alien men entangled with Earth women.

(Slavery is illegal on Jota.) He manages to escape and heads for Earth where he can make tons of money by create a powerful drug, Vahst, derived from the human brain. Vahst&#8211;it reads as dopamine&#8211;is generated when humans orgasm. Kane&#8217;s MO is to brutally kill humans after they&#8217;ve come and harvest the serum. He&#8217;s a slaver as well.</p>\n<p>Jotans must have sex when the temperature is high or else they feel tortuorous pain and begin to go mad. Kane has landed on Earth during a heat wave and his need for constant sex is intense. The same is true for the other Jotan on Earth, Tagen Pahnee, an officer of the Jotan Off-World Security Fleet, who is pursuing Kane to bring him to justice. Unlike Kane who has visited Earth before, Tegan has not. Earth is an utter mystery to him and he is far more at its mercy than is Kane.</p>\n<p>Stranded on Earth, far from their homes, Kane and Tegan navigate a perilous environment teeming with humans and unforeseen dangers exacerbated by the intense Heat. This challenging backdrop adds layers of complexity to their quests. Both men need sex and both are determined to get the thing they most seek: Kane, Vahst; Tagen, Kane. And while it&#8217;s true that Kane is flat out evil, by the standards of both his world and ours, and Tagen is good, both men have motivations that make their choices morally murky.</p>\n<p>This is a dark dark book. There is endless rape, murder, mayhem, and fear. The novel delves into dark themes and morally ambiguous situations, creating a gripping narrative that will most definitely challenge some readers&#8217; comfort zones. It challenges mine but I still love it.</p>\n<p>One reason for this is that Smith&#8217;s characters are indelible. Kane and the human lover he finds, Raven, are BAD and yet they and their love story&#8211;it is a love story&#8211;are thoughtfully and believably portrayed. Tagen and his ultimate partner, Daria, are almost as compelling and certainly much easier to root for. For much of the story, the book switches back and forth between Kane&#8217;s and Raven&#8217;s murderous path and Tagen&#8217;s and Daria&#8217;s tentative relationship. Kane and Raven are enjoying the hell out of themselves while Tagen&#8217;s resolute goodness makes him and Daria suffer. It takes many many pages before the good guys get any kind of an upper hand and the body count accrued over that time is high. You can&#8217;t look away from all the violence simply because you&#8217;ll so want to see what happens next.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s rare I&#8217;d recommend, to romance readers, a book with so much rape, murder, and cruelty. But recommend <strong>Heat</strong> I do. Tagen and Daria get the HEA they deserve&#8211;their ending is very smartly done&#8211;and Raven and Kane, well, you&#8217;ll have to read the book to see what happens to them. If you decide to give this a chance, understand it&#8217;s the opposite of fluffy. But, even with all its darkness, it is one hell of a read.</p>\n",

Kane and the human lover he finds, Raven, are BAD and yet they and their love story&#8211;it is a love story&#8211;are thoughtfully and believably portrayed. Tagen and his ultimate partner, Daria, are almost as compelling and certainly much easier to root for. For much of the story, the book switches back and forth between Kane&#8217;s and Raven&#8217;s murderous path and Tagen&#8217;s and Daria&#8217;s tentative relationship. Kane and Raven are enjoying the hell out of themselves while Tagen&#8217;s resolute goodness makes him and Daria suffer. It takes many many pages before the good guys get any kind of an upper hand and the body count accrued over that time is high. You can&#8217;t look away from all the violence simply because you&#8217;ll so want to see what happens next. It&#8217;s rare I&#8217;d recommend, to romance readers, a book with so much rape, murder, and cruelty. But recommend Heat I do. Tagen and Daria get the HEA they deserve&#8211;their ending is very smartly done&#8211;and Raven and Kane, well, you&#8217;ll have to read the book to see what happens to them. If you decide to give this a chance, understand it&#8217;s the opposite of fluffy. But, even with all its darkness, it is one hell of a read."

Curious what the fuss was about, I decided to give the series a whirl.</p>\n<p>The series opens with <strong>Protecting Us</strong>, a novella that essentially serves as a long prologue to the first full-length novel, <strong>Fighting for Us</strong>. The lovers here are Grace and Asher, childhood besties who grow up to be each other&#8217;s soul mates. The first 75% of the novella tracks their progress from tree-climbing kids to besotted adults. This part reads like a million other romances I&#8217;ve read&#8211;it&#8217;s clear from the first paragraph that the two are meant to be. Things are perfect until, very suddenly, it all goes terribly wrong.</p>\n<p>Their love story resumes in <strong>Fighting for Us</strong> which takes place seven years later. Asher returns home to their small town of Tilikum, Washington when he is released from prison. (I told you: their lives went off the rails at the end of <strong>Protecting You</strong>.) The two have had no contact since Asher was incarcerated&#8211;he says that is the only way he could have survived&#8211;and Asher is sure that Grace must have moved on. This, of course, is not true&#8211;the two are, after all, soulmates.</p>\n<p>When Asher realizes the woman he loved still loves him he does not embrace her with open arms. Nope, he is, he reasons, too damaged from the long years of violence he lived in jail. And kudos to Kingsley for showing the reader that, yes, Asher is damaged. His time inside has left him paranoid, adrift, rage-filled, and unable to sleep. It&#8217;s believable that he would believe it would be wrong to tie Grace, the person he loves more than life itself, to such a f*cked up man.</p>\n<p>Grace, though, knows that true love means getting through the tough times together and she is determined to get Asher to see that, no matter who he is now, they belong together still. This conflict is believable but, over the course of the book&#8217;s 500 plus pages, becomes repetitive.</p>\n<p>Additionally, these books present overly idealized characters. The other Baileys, Grace, and even the local shopkeepers in the small Cascade Mountains town where the stories are set, don&#8217;t feel believable. I&#8217;m all for stories about those we can admire but almost everyone in these books is too flawless for me. The worst is Gram, Asher&#8217;s grandmother (and, when he&#8217;s out of prison, his landlady). Asher and his four brothers were orphaned when they were young and Gram and her husband raised them. Gram is Native American and is the story&#8217;s literal wise woman&#8211;discomfitingly, her portrayal veers close to caricature.</p>\n<p>The only person who is genuinely flawed is the hero. Asher is an MMA fighter whose violent response to a threat to Grace landed him in prison. He is, throughout both books, without regret for the actions that led to his prison sentence. This makes him morally iffy and I wish that Kingsley had given him more a redemption that involved forgiving himself <em>and</em> those he attacked.</p>\n<p>Despite my reservations about Asher&#8217;s character, I can see why Grace is so dedicated to him. Real love means loving your partner through good times and bad, and Grace, though clearheaded about Asher&#8217;s struggles, comes across as a patient and compassionate woman. I adored her relationship with her best friend, Cara although there is too much foreshadowing about the latter&#8217;s obvious pairing with another Bailey brother.</p>\n<p>If you like dirty talk, there&#8217;s plenty here&#8211;is it just me or is talking about your genitalia in third person somewhat weird? I prefered the banter of the brothers to the bedroom chitchat. Really, the best thing about the series is the brothers and their lovely, often amusing, interactions. I&#8217;m sticking with the series for them and I can completely understand why so many readers have fallen under the Bailey brothers&#8217; spell.</p>\n<p>Both books unnecessarily together top 700 pages. I found myself skimming chapter after chapter&#8211;Kingsley is a good writer but these novels would have benefitted from some serious pruning.</p>\n<p>In the end, I&#8217;d rate the first two Bailey Brothers series a solid C+. While the romances might not be the strongest point, the witty banter between the brothers and the delightful friendship dynamics are clear winners. However, if you&#8217;re looking for a deeper emotional connection in your romance novels, this might not be your ultimate destination. And be prepared for characters who are almost too perfect to be true.</p>\n",

This conflict is believable but, over the course of the book&#8217;s 500 plus pages, becomes repetitive. Additionally, these books present overly idealized characters. The other Baileys, Grace, and even the local shopkeepers in the small Cascade Mountains town where the stories are set, don&#8217;t feel believable. I&#8217;m all for stories about those we can admire but almost everyone in these books is too flawless for me. The worst is Gram, Asher&#8217;s grandmother (and, when he&#8217;s out of prison, his landlady). Asher and his four brothers were orphaned when they were young and Gram and her husband raised them. Gram is Native American and is the story&#8217;s literal wise woman&#8211;discomfitingly, her portrayal veers close to caricature. The only person who is genuinely flawed is the hero. Asher is an MMA fighter whose violent response to a threat to Grace landed him in prison. He is, throughout both books, without regret for the actions that led to his prison sentence. This makes him morally iffy and I wish that Kingsley had given him more a redemption that involved forgiving himself and those he attacked. Despite my reservations about Asher&#8217;s character, I can see why Grace is so dedicated to him. Real love means loving your partner through good times and bad, and Grace, though clearheaded about Asher&#8217;s struggles, comes across as a patient and compassionate woman. I adored her relationship with her best friend, Cara although there is too much foreshadowing about the latter&#8217;s obvious pairing with another Bailey brother. If you like dirty talk, there&#8217;s plenty here&#8211;is it just me or is talking about your genitalia in third person somewhat weird? I prefered the banter of the brothers to the bedroom chitchat. Really, the best thing about the series is the brothers and their lovely, often amusing, interactions. I&#8217;m sticking with the series for them and I can completely understand why so many readers have fallen under the Bailey brothers&#8217; spell. Both books unnecessarily together top 700 pages. I found myself skimming chapter after chapter&#8211;Kingsley is a good writer but these novels would have benefitted from some serious pruning. In the end, I&#8217;d rate the first two Bailey Brothers series a solid C+. While the romances might not be the strongest point, the witty banter between the brothers and the delightful friendship dynamics are clear winners. However, if you&#8217;re looking for a deeper emotional connection in your romance novels, this might not be your ultimate destination. And be prepared for characters who are almost too perfect to be true."

Through her lens, we peer into the wings of community theater, her voyage from childhood dreams to the slings and arrows of an adult actor&#8217;s reality.

Its hero, Tiernan Verran, is the current King of the Dark Fae who rule Las Vegas. Like many a second son, Tiernan never planned on being a monarch but due to the events in the better first entry, <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/the-dark-king-by-gina-maxwell/\"><strong>The Dark King</strong></a>, his older brother resigned, leaving Tiernan stuck with the job.</p>\n<p>There are many things he dislikes about being King including the crimp it&#8217;s put in his regular hook-ups with Fiona, a half-fae maid who works in the Verran hotel Nightfall. (If you are looking for a thoughtful exploration of power dynamics in a workplace romance, don&#8217;t read this book.)

And then, SO STRESSFUL, it turns out that the best way to disarm the bad guys is for Fiona to go undercover as a stripper at a club where fae women keep going missing.

His own parents were&#8211;his marvelous mother still is&#8211;so eccentric they were socially shunned.

And, for the first half of the book, that&#8217;s pretty much all that happens. Stella has the hots for Silvester. Silvester has the hots for Yasmin. And Yasmin clearly has the hots for Giles Renwick, Earl of Lilford whom, I came to realize, she married in the first book. It didn&#8217;t work for me and had James not so excelled at this book&#8217;s banter&#8211;I haven&#8217;t laughed at a James book this much since <strong><a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/three-weeks-with-lady-x/\">Three Weeks with Lady X</a>&#8211;</strong>-I might have put the novel down.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Silvester gets his head out of his ass and realizes that not only is Yasmin in love with one of his oldest friends, he, Silvester, is utterly entranced by Stella. But Stella, after over a hundred pages of watching Silvester pursue Yasmin, doesn&#8217;t believe he cares for her. (The title is misleading&#8211;she really does always want <strong>that</strong> Duke&#8211;it&#8217;s just she thinks he&#8217;s not for her.) And honestly, I was sort of with her.</p>\n<p>Stella is a wonderful woman, brilliant, strong-willed, resilient; someone who doesn&#8217;t want to compromise who she is for anyone. In fact, this is one of those books that it&#8217;s a bit hard to buy that no one wanted Stella. She&#8217;s a classic James heroine&#8211;she could be the auburn twin of Mia, the heroine of <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/four-nights-with-the-duke/\"><strong>Four Nights With the Duke</strong></a>, whom I adore. She&#8217;s curvy, very funny, and has a heart of gold. (Her true love, for much of the novel, is her rescued kitten Specs who steals every scene she&#8217;s in.) Silvester is damn lucky she waited for him to come to his senses.</p>\n<p>Despite this pitfall, ultimately I very much enjoyed Silvester and Stella&#8217;s story. James masterfully depicts Silvester&#8217;s confusion and frustration and I found myself forgiving him for his earlier idiocy. The tenor of the book is airy, charming, and wonderfully sly. The love scenes are both sweet and very very dirty (for James). This is a book with great affection for its characters, especially its women. Stella&#8217;s aunt and Silvester&#8217;s mother each are given deep backstories of their own and both stories are moving and, in ways that seem believable, empowering.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s another author&#8217;s note in the book, this time at the end. In it James writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"calibre11 pcalibre2\">I grew up in a farmhouse full of books, the oldest child of two eccentric, creative parents: my father was a poet and my mother a short story writer. A couple of miles away, down a few dirt roads, was a small Minnesota town . . . where I never fit in. I was too weird, too addicted to reading, too plump. Like Stella, I was no good at disguising who I am. Thankfully, unlike Regency England, no girl is forced to attend the junior prom. I stayed home and catalogued my romances, practicing skills that would make me an English professor—and a romance writer&#8230;.</p>\n<p class=\"calibre12\">It took me a long time to shake my experiences in middle school. Stella was shamed for her freckles, her reading, and her girth. Silvester created a suit of armor to offset his boyhood shame. Luckily, Silvester and Stella find their way together to a different way of being in the world.</p>\n<p class=\"calibre12\">So this book is dedicated to my husband, Alessandro.</p>\n<p class=\"calibre12\">When he fell in love with me, I felt like the most beautiful, intelligent, and desirable woman in the world. Love isn’t about reality, but perception, and I’m so grateful to have spent half my life looking through his eyes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sigh&#8230; I found that lovely, just like this book (after I got through the first half!)</p>\n<p>So, yes, read this book. Just read <strong>The Reluctant Countess</strong> first.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

When he fell in love with me, I felt like the most beautiful, intelligent, and desirable woman in the world. Love isn’t about reality, but perception, and I’m so grateful to have spent half my life looking through his eyes. Sigh&#8230; I found that lovely, just like this book (after I got through the first half!) So, yes, read this book. Just read The Reluctant Countess first. &nbsp;"

At one of her father&#8217;s California garages, she sees Josh, an ambitious 30-year-old mechanic&#8211;he dreams of running his own high-end car refurbishment garage. She asks him to teach her about racing, and after they flirt for a while, even as Josh knows it&#8217;s a <em>very bad idea</em> to do anything with the big boss&#8217;s daughter, that night he takes her for a very fast ride.

And she tries to but there&#8217;s a snow storm, a non-life threatening car accident, and the next thing you know the two are forced to share Josh&#8217;s small apartment for three days. Guess what happens next?</p>\n<p>Look, this plot may not break new ground, but York makes it bunches of fun to read. The pages practically sizzle with the scorching chemistry between Josh and Monica, both of whom are impossible not to cheer for. And once Josh&#8217;s family&#8211;they&#8217;re all pretty great&#8211;decide to get involved, the book becomes funny as well as smokin&#8217; hot.</p>\n<p><strong>Rebel at Heart</strong> is thoroughly entertaining and hits all the right notes. Josh and Monica both have to find their way to both romantic and professional happiness and they do so in ways that feel appropriate to the plot. The ending is satisfying (although there&#8217;s an auction I could have done without) and lets Josh and Monica each wield the power they have earned. I very much enjoyed my time in Pine Harbour and look forward to reading other Kincaid love stories! (Here&#8217;s hoping there&#8217;s at least a novella about Bianca, Monica&#8217;s mom, and the time she came to Pine Harbour&#8230;..)</p>\n",

Guess what happens next? Look, this plot may not break new ground, but York makes it bunches of fun to read. The pages practically sizzle with the scorching chemistry between Josh and Monica, both of whom are impossible not to cheer for. And once Josh&#8217;s family&#8211;they&#8217;re all pretty great&#8211;decide to get involved, the book becomes funny as well as smokin&#8217; hot. Rebel at Heart is thoroughly entertaining and hits all the right notes. Josh and Monica both have to find their way to both romantic and professional happiness and they do so in ways that feel appropriate to the plot. The ending is satisfying (although there&#8217;s an auction I could have done without) and lets Josh and Monica each wield the power they have earned. I very much enjoyed my time in Pine Harbour and look forward to reading other Kincaid love stories! (Here&#8217;s hoping there&#8217;s at least a novella about Bianca, Monica&#8217;s mom, and the time she came to Pine Harbour&#8230;..)"

                "html": "<p>In the author&#8217;s note of her debut novel, <strong>Forever Your Rogue</strong>, Erin Langston writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I had been halfheartedly researching an entirely different plot for <strong>Forever Your Rogue</strong> when I stumbled upon a piece of legal scholarship that completely ignited my story. The case, De Manneville v. De Manneville (1804), involved a mother seeking custody of her still-nursing infant daughter, who had been taken from her by her estranged husband. I remember looking down at my own still-nursing infant daughter and feeling sick when I learned that the court supported the father’s claim to sole custody of the baby. As a woman, Mrs. De Manneville had no legal rights to her child.</p>\n<p>The only thing I know about Mrs. De Manneville is that her husband took away her baby, and even though she knew it was likely to be a nonstarter, she still pursued legal action. Ultimately, she failed. As did the vast majority of mothers who sought custody of their children in the early 1800s. What struck me most about these stories wasn’t the consistent court ruling that fathers have absolute authority; after all, there were stringent laws and expectations around a woman’s legal standing in this period. What struck me most was that they tried anyway.</p>\n<p>Cora’s story was my way of giving all of those women their own happy endings. My novel was born from their trying.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Readers&#8211;Cora&#8217;s story is simply marvelous. I&#8217;ve not read a historical romance published in the past few years I loved as much as I do <strong>Forever Your Rogue</strong>. Smart, sexy, and powerfully grounded in history, written in clean, clear prose&#8211;this book is the definition of a Desert Island Keeper. (DIK)</p>\n<p>Lord Dane, Cora&#8217;s perfectly awful husband, has been dead almost a year, a fact Cora is deeply grateful for. Dane was the sort who didn&#8217;t bother to record their daughter Tess&#8217; birth in his family tree and who viewed Cora and their children Tess and Leo, as uninteresting items he owned. His death&#8211;he crashed his curricle en route to see his latest mistress&#8211;should have enabled Cora and her children to live in peace. But Dane, ever the controlling asshat, designated his awful sister&#8217;s husband as the children&#8217;s legal guardian.</p>\n<p>As Cora&#8217;s brother, Gavin Sinclair explains,</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Because of the laws of coverture, Lord Dane was the only person on earth with legal rights to my sister’s children. He could designate, upon his death, any guardian for them he wished.”</p>\n<p>&#8230; “A guardianship customarily is handled thusly.” Sinclair was now really warming up to his task. “A mother is often named the guardian of nurture—that means she can see to the daily care and wellbeing of her child. The father’s will may also name a testamentary guardian, who oversees the child’s personal finances and makes legal decisions, including matters of education and marriage.

                "text": "In the author&#8217;s note of her debut novel, Forever Your Rogue, Erin Langston writes: I had been halfheartedly researching an entirely different plot for Forever Your Rogue when I stumbled upon a piece of legal scholarship that completely ignited my story. The case, De Manneville v. De Manneville (1804), involved a mother seeking custody of her still-nursing infant daughter, who had been taken from her by her estranged husband. I remember looking down at my own still-nursing infant daughter and feeling sick when I learned that the court supported the father’s claim to sole custody of the baby. As a woman, Mrs. De Manneville had no legal rights to her child. The only thing I know about Mrs. De Manneville is that her husband took away her baby, and even though she knew it was likely to be a nonstarter, she still pursued legal action. Ultimately, she failed. As did the vast majority of mothers who sought custody of their children in the early 1800s. What struck me most about these stories wasn’t the consistent court ruling that fathers have absolute authority; after all, there were stringent laws and expectations around a woman’s legal standing in this period. What struck me most was that they tried anyway. Cora’s story was my way of giving all of those women their own happy endings. My novel was born from their trying. Readers&#8211;Cora&#8217;s story is simply marvelous. I&#8217;ve not read a historical romance published in the past few years I loved as much as I do Forever Your Rogue. Smart, sexy, and powerfully grounded in history, written in clean, clear prose&#8211;this book is the definition of a Desert Island Keeper. (DIK) Lord Dane, Cora&#8217;s perfectly awful husband, has been dead almost a year, a fact Cora is deeply grateful for. Dane was the sort who didn&#8217;t bother to record their daughter Tess&#8217; birth in his family tree and who viewed Cora and their children Tess and Leo, as uninteresting items he owned. His death&#8211;he crashed his curricle en route to see his latest mistress&#8211;should have enabled Cora and her children to live in peace. But Dane, ever the controlling asshat, designated his awful sister&#8217;s husband as the children&#8217;s legal guardian. As Cora&#8217;s brother, Gavin Sinclair explains, “Because of the laws of coverture, Lord Dane was the only person on earth with legal rights to my sister’s children. He could designate, upon his death, any guardian for them he wished.” &#8230; “A guardianship customarily is handled thusly.” Sinclair was now really warming up to his task. “A mother is often named the guardian of nurture—that means she can see to the daily care and wellbeing of her child. The father’s will may also name a testamentary guardian, who oversees the child’s personal finances and makes legal decisions, including matters of education and marriage. Both the guardian of nurture and the testamentary guardian have claim to the child’s physical custody.” &#8230; “Cora is, indeed, Tess and Leo’s guardian of nurture,” Sinclair continued matter-of-factly. “It’s why she can remain at Aldworth Park as long as Leo is in her physical custody. Now, if Dane’s will had been typical, I would have been named the testamentary guardian. I’m Cora’s closest brother, and I can’t inherit from Leo.” He smiled sadly at his sister. “Though in truth, I would have very little to do. Cora is an exceptional mother.” &#8230; “Dane, of course, did not select Gavin.” Cora’s voice was brittle. “Instead, he named his brother-in-law—his sister Edith’s husband—as my children’s legal guardian.

His review of <strong>Sea of Ruin</strong>, which may be found <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51416396-sea-of-ruin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>, is so engagingly hilarious I had to check out the book for myself. That&#8217;s five hours of my life I&#8217;ll never get back. Sigh.</p>\n<p>As a rule, I am all for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>the suspension of disbelief</em> </a>in art. I don&#8217;t need to actually believe in time travel to enjoy <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/outlander-by-diana-gabaldon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Outlander</strong></a>.

Four have found their soulmates, all of whom wish to stay in Rush Creek, and, in Wilder at Last, it&#8217;s the youngest, the panty-melter brother, Easton&#8217;s turn.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve read the series, you&#8217;ve figured out Easton&#8217;s true love is Hanna Hott with whom he&#8217;s grown up. Like Easton, Hannah is the youngest of six&#8211;yes, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hott-Shot-Steamy-Romantic-Comedy-ebook/dp/B0BNPHCLPN/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1AOLBFOUO3GPC&amp;keywords=hott+shot+serena+bell&amp;qid=1673798047&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=hott+shot+serena+%2Cdigital-text%2C85&amp;sr=1-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the next set of books will feature the five presumably hot Hott brothers</a>&#8211;but unlike him, she doesn&#8217;t come from a loving family. (The Wilders are the dream team of families.) Hanna, who lives with her hilariously cranky 85 year old grandfather, is, however, an honorary Wilder. She works as a trip leader for Wilder Adventures, the company all the Wilders and their partners are connected to, and her girl posse is all Wilder women. Hanna loves the Wilders, loves her job, and loves Rush Creek. And she loves pranking Easton just as much as he loves pranking her.</p>\n<p>As the book opens, Hanna has just</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"subsq\">covered every inch of Easton Wilder’s work cube with sticky notes. His computer, his keyboard, his desk, the walls of the cube, the front of the desk. I used six different colors, arranged in many patterns, including a smiley face of sticky notes glommed on Easton’s computer screen. It’s basically art.</p>\n<p class=\"subsq\">Today is Easton’s birthday, and my sticky-note “gift” is payback for his last birthday “present” to me, which was replacing the contents of my deep bottom file drawer with a terrarium. Stones, little plastic plants, a leopard gecko.</p>\n<p class=\"subsq\">Some people might call our pranks mean, but Easton and I, we’ve always been like this. Finding ways to make each other’s lives… more colorful. More interesting. And yeah, sometimes a little more difficult—but in the best possible way.</p>\n<p class=\"subsq\">I do a happy jiggle to celebrate my own brilliance. Easton’s gonna love it. Or hate it, which is the same thing when it comes to lifetime frenemies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>An astute romance reader recognizes this for what it is: sublimated lust just waiting to be set free. The device Bell uses for this is Hanna&#8217;s having the hots for another man, celebrity chef and YouTube sensation Bear Warden. Wilder Adventures has hired Bear to take their clients on trips based around foraging and preparing food in the wild. The minute Hanna sees Bear, she is struck dumb.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"subsq\">Bear Warden on the screen did <i class=\"calibre2\">not </i>prepare me for Bear Warden in the flesh. He’s gorgeous.</p>\n<p class=\"subsq\">I mean, not quite as gorgeous as Easton, standing beside him, but ever since Easton started dating mean girls in middle school, I’ve discounted him as a <i class=\"calibre2\">man</i> and thought of him more as a work of art with a sense of humor and bad taste in women. It’s a helpful, ever-present reminder that he’s off limits, even as an object of fantasy.</p>\n<p class=\"subsq\">The man next to Easton is probably six-foot-four. Broad as a barn, though not the Wilder-brother molded-from-marble version. Softer, more dad-bodied—if your dad was a grizzly bear. He has reddish-brown hair, a thick and impeccably trimmed coppery beard, full lips, and bright blue eyes. Up close, he’s vivid.</p>\n<p class=\"subsq\">Something has happened to my brain.</p>\n<p class=\"subsq\">Well, really, to my body.</p>\n<p class=\"subsq\">As in, my body—specifically, my vagina—hijacked all the blood from my brain.</p>\n<p class=\"subsq\">Which is a big deal, because ever since I moved Easton from the middle-school-crush category to <i class=\"calibre2\">nope</i>, this doesn’t happen to me very often, with men or women.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hanna promptly blackmails Easton&#8211;she overheard him asking Bear for a job, something that is verboten because Wilders must work for Wilder Adventures&#8211;into helping her get Bear into the sack. Hanna&#8217;s not looking for love&#8211;her feckless parents and absentee brothers have left her believing she&#8217;s not worthy&#8211;she just wants to roll around the sheets with dad bod Bear.</p>\n<p>High jinks ensue, some very funny and some not. The blackmail is kinda yucky. The plot depends on both Easton and Hanna being as <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/movies/2020/7/17/21327905/clueless-jane-austen-adaptations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">clueless</a> as<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rked3iy4k-w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Dionne on the highway</a>. There is no problem that can&#8217;t be solved by compassion, words of wisdom from your peeps, and comfy clothes because the <strong><em>Wilder</em></strong> books eschew angsty conflict or difficult choices. They, like Jill Shalvis&#8217;<a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/review-tag/lucky-harbor-series/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em><strong> Lucky Harbor</strong></em></a> books, are feel good paeans to the best of us served with a side of snark and sexy times. In Rush Creek, everyone is loved, supported, and encouraging. It&#8217;s a world where all sexual orientations are valued, all body types are beautiful, and sibling rivalry melts away in the face of regular family dinners. If books were hugs, this one is a giant happy group pile on.</p>\n<p>So, if you need a hug, a comforting, familiar hug, you&#8217;ll enjoy <strong>Wilder at Last</strong>. Here (unlike my favorite Bell, <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/sleepover-by-serena-bell-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Sleepover)</strong></a> the writing is sugar and spice and everything nice. This easy to read love story has quippy banter and steamy sex in tent, progressive values and a prescient dog. For many many readers, that&#8217;s a treat. It&#8217;s hard to hate on happiness and I&#8217;m not even going to try. If you love this sort of thing&#8211;and if you do, you are in good company&#8211;<strong>Wilder at Last</strong> will charm you and leave you smiling.</p>\n",

Her latest, <strong>The Worst Woman in London</strong>, is a refreshing, generous tale that tells two love stories as it explores the abhorrent impact on women of divorce law in the Victorian age.</p>\n<p>James Standish first meets Francesca Heller when she is nineteen and he is twenty-six. She is the intended of his best friend, Edward Thorne. James realizes, within minutes, the Thorne marriage is doomed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"block_3\">Miss Heller simply wasn’t the right girl for Thorne. James knew by the way she hid her laughter, by her sadness when Thorne patronized her, and by a dozen other insignificant details. If the ceremony went ahead in three days, it might prove the worst mistake of her life.</p>\n<p class=\"block_3\">If it were any other man, the two might marry, realize their mistake, and make the best of things, but Thorne was a romantic and he’d rhapsodized at length on Miss Heller’s delicacy, her girlish ignorance, and sweet compliance. When he realized she wasn’t the girl of his dreams, his spirits wouldn’t just plummet, but crash. When people tumbled from their pedestals, as they generally did sooner or later, Thorne didn’t hesitate to cut them out of his life. Even his own father.</p>\n<p class=\"block_3\">The girl didn’t understand, not consciously, and Thorne hadn’t a clue.</p>\n<p class=\"block_3\">Perhaps James ought to say something.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>James says nothing and Francesca and Edward marry within weeks. The union is, as James foresaw, a disaster.</p>\n<p>Our story then moves forward ten years, the Thornes have lived apart for the past eight&#8211;Edward with his mistresses in London, Francesca in the country. Francesca, much to the horror of society and Edward, is insisting on divorce. She wishes to be truly free of Edward and is unwilling to continue on as they have. Pursuing this end means she&#8217;s lost her standing in society&#8211;even the uncle and aunt who raised her won&#8217;t speak to her&#8211;as well as almost all of her money.</p>\n<p>Edward finds her behavior <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhXjcZdk5QQ\">inconceivable</a>. He tries to change her mind&#8211;</p>\n<blockquote><p>“You didn’t used to mind doing what&#8217;s expected.” Edward’s voice, quiet with reproach, brought her back to the here and now. The words hung in the air and quashed any triumph she might feel at resisting his tactics. “Are their expectations really so onerous? You don’t want to live with me. We’ll live apart then. They can tolerate that. Surely you can content yourself for your family’s sake. A divorce gains you nothing and causes them, causes all of us, a great deal of unpleasantness.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8211;and when that doesn&#8217;t work, enlists James to make Fran an offer.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“To be precise, I’m willing to offer five thousand pounds per annum to be paid in quarterly installments.

James is a man well aware of the value of money. He was raised by his acerbic aunt Miriam whose heir he is. He&#8217;s never worked a day in his life&#8211;men of his class just didn&#8217;t&#8211;and though he doesn&#8217;t love answering to his aunt, he knows better than to threaten his own financial security.

                "text": "from The New York Times in October 2022: Colleen Hoover has sold more books this year than Dr. Seuss. She’s sold more books than James Patterson and John Grisham — combined. To say she’s currently the best-selling novelist in the United States, to even compare her to other successful authors who have landed several books on the best seller lists, fails to capture the size and loyalty of her audience. She holds six of the top 10 spots on The New York Times’s paperback fiction best-seller list, a stunning number of simultaneous best sellers from a single author. She has sold 8.6 million print books this year alone — more copies than the Bible, according to NPD BookScan. We at AAR have never reviewed Colleen Hoover. So, when Verity was a Steal and Deal a few weeks ago, I snapped it up. The book begins with an act of violence. Our narrator (she is one of two&#8211;the other, the eponymous Verity), Lowen Ashleigh tells us in the book&#8217;s very first line: &#8220;I hear the crack of his skull before the spattering of blood reaches me.&#8221; I gasped, for the first and last time. Lowen, on her way to a meeting with her publisher, has just watched a man step into the street&#8211;he was, of course, on his phone&#8211;and get smashed to bits by a truck.

Not because she cares especially about the stranger&#8217;s death but because the white shirt she donned for her meeting is now a red and white shirt and that, she thinks, will not impress the editor she is on her way to meet. Lowen, a self-described introvert, is about to be evicted from her apartment. She&#8217;s broke, unemployed, and down to the last pennies of her last advance from her last poorly selling book.

His name, he tells her, is Jeremy and he and Lowen have a moment. But he has a wedding ring on his left hand and Lowen, worried about being late for her meeting, watches him walk away. She, however, runs into him almost immediately in the publisher&#8217;s lobby. Not Shockingly, Jeremy is also at this meeting. Jeremy is married to wildly successful Verity Crawford, an author of riveting and unsettling murder mysteries.

Because if not&#8211;and you&#8217;re a loon if you haven&#8217;t&#8211;this review is a waste of your time. <strong>Hell Bent</strong> is the second book in Leigh Bardugo&#8217;s <strong><em>Alex Stern</em></strong> series and will likely to confuse those who haven&#8217;t read the first. But for those of you who have&#8230; here goes.</p>\n<p>Our story begins a few months after the literally spellbinding conclusion of <strong>Ninth House</strong> in which Darlington was sent to Hell by a now dead dean. Alex (Galaxy) Stern, now the Virgil of Lethe, the house that monitors the use of magic by Yale&#8217;s famed secret societies, has a lot on her plate. There&#8217;s the usual challenge of trying to pass her classes (her background as a low level drug dealer in L. A. really didn&#8217;t prepare her academically for the Ivy League), her work for Lethe (the ghosts she can see are more aggressive than ever), her very scary ex-boss in L.A. is forcing her to work for him, and, despite being told to drop it, she&#8217;s determined to open a portal to Hell and rescue Darlington, her mentor and possible paramour. To top it off, something is in Black Elm, Darlington&#8217;s large and dark house and that something is freaking Alex out.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Alex, now in her second year at Yale, has a squad. There&#8217;s Pamela Dawes, the current Oculus at Lethe whose research skills are beyond impressive; Turner, a detective of the New Haven Police Department and liaison between Lethe House and the Chief of Police; Mercy Zhao, Alex&#8217;s roommate; and Tripp Helmuth, third generation Bonesman. All but one are, surprisingly, murderers and Alex will need them all in order to save Darlington and, to a lesser extent, the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Hell Bent</strong> proffers a profusion of riches. As is true in every Bardugo book, the world building is meticulous, dense, and brilliant. Not only is Yale so vividly portrayed it might has well be a character but New Haven, which Alex has to venture into on the orders of Eitan, her old supplier, is crisply manifested as well. The gripping plot is full of clever twists, and the writing is vivid and intelligent, with moments of wit and humor. However, the standout aspect of the book are the well-developed characters, particularly the four murderers, who each have a rich backstory that allows the reader to understand and empathize with them as they navigate the challenges of their journey through hell.</p>\n<p><strong>Hell Bent</strong> isn&#8217;t quite as gripping as <strong>Ninth House, </strong>perhaps because the catchy conceit of the series is no longer new.  And, like <strong>Ninth House</strong>, it ends on a cliffhanger although this one is far more abrupt. I will be eagerly anticipating the next installment&#8211;Bardugo has said she&#8217;d like to write at least five books featuring Alex&#8211;as will, I suspect thousands of others. Read these books, peeps. I promise, you&#8217;ll be transported.

To top it off, something is in Black Elm, Darlington&#8217;s large and dark house and that something is freaking Alex out. Fortunately, Alex, now in her second year at Yale, has a squad. There&#8217;s Pamela Dawes, the current Oculus at Lethe whose research skills are beyond impressive; Turner, a detective of the New Haven Police Department and liaison between Lethe House and the Chief of Police; Mercy Zhao, Alex&#8217;s roommate; and Tripp Helmuth, third generation Bonesman. All but one are, surprisingly, murderers and Alex will need them all in order to save Darlington and, to a lesser extent, the world. Hell Bent proffers a profusion of riches. As is true in every Bardugo book, the world building is meticulous, dense, and brilliant. Not only is Yale so vividly portrayed it might has well be a character but New Haven, which Alex has to venture into on the orders of Eitan, her old supplier, is crisply manifested as well. The gripping plot is full of clever twists, and the writing is vivid and intelligent, with moments of wit and humor. However, the standout aspect of the book are the well-developed characters, particularly the four murderers, who each have a rich backstory that allows the reader to understand and empathize with them as they navigate the challenges of their journey through hell. Hell Bent isn&#8217;t quite as gripping as Ninth House, perhaps because the catchy conceit of the series is no longer new.  And, like Ninth House, it ends on a cliffhanger although this one is far more abrupt. I will be eagerly anticipating the next installment&#8211;Bardugo has said she&#8217;d like to write at least five books featuring Alex&#8211;as will, I suspect thousands of others. Read these books, peeps. I promise, you&#8217;ll be transported. (Hopefully, however, not to Hell.)"

Clayton, born Nicholas Harp, hailed from Longbill and had a connection to Emily back in the day. Andrea is determined to find out what truly happened to Emily, in part because she is trying to determine if Clayton was Emily&#8217;s killer&#8211;Andrea very much does not want Clayton to be free and were he to be charged with more crimes, he&#8217;d remain incarcerated.

When Owusu sends the evidence for examination, he learns the bones are connected to a cold case that left three people dead on the kitchen floor in a Chelsea mansion thirty years ago.</i></p>\n<p><em>Rachel Rimmer has also received a shock—news that her husband, Michael, has been found dead in the cellar of his house in France. All signs point to an intruder, and the French police need her to come urgently to answer questions about Michael and his past that she very much doesn’t want to answer.</em></p>\n<p><em>As they all race to discover answers to these convoluted mysteries, they will come to find that they’re connected in ways they could have never imagined.</em></p>\n<p>Dabney and Maggie are both fans of Lisa Jewell&#8217;s writing and are here to discuss her new book, <strong>The Family Remains</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Maggie</strong>: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The back blurb describes </span><b>The Family Remains</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as a stand-alone sequel but I have to admit that I didn&#8217;t feel that way. (It&#8217;s a sequel to <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/the-family-upstairs-by-lisa-jewell/\"><strong>The Family Upstairs</strong></a>.) Knowing who most of these characters are and their backstory really makes a difference in how you read the tale. What do you think? Did this work as a standalone?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Dabney</strong>: Well… I didn’t realize until I finished it that it was a sequel, of sorts. And I loved it! So I think, if you don’t know better, it works just fine as a standalone. That said, I suspect having read </span><a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/the-family-upstairs-by-lisa-jewell/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>The Family Upstairs</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> might have made for a richer reading experience. Was that the case for you?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Maggie</strong>: Yes.I think otherwise some of the behaviors/events would have seemed odd or downright inexplicable.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How would you describe these characters just based on what you learned in this text?&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Dabney</strong>: It’s true that Lucy, Henry, and Phin were all very mysterious for the first part of the book. But as someone who reads a ton of mysteries, I found that to be normal. My take was that they all had secrets I’d discover as I read which did indeed happen.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Maggie</strong>. I think that’s a good take on it, though I would argue that in the first novel, which was more of a psychological thriller/gothic than a mystery, they all had much deeper, darker edges to them. Henry especially seemed less somehow; the Henry of the </span><b>The Family Remains</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> appears almost incapable of doing what the Henry of </span><b>The Family Upstairs </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">did. I’d also argue that there is no real mystery at the start of the novel for those of us who read that first volume. We know what happened to whom and why.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On another note, let’s talk about the characters unique to this tale. I thought Marco was what Henry would have been if it weren’t for Henry’s horrific childhood and I absolutely loved him. Normally, youngsters that savvy drive me crazy but he was great. Rachel is another “newcomer” and I found her tale riveting. She’s so strong, resilient, and positive. A Lucy without all the darkness that has defined that woman’s life.

                "text": "Early one morning on the shore of the Thames, DCI Samuel Owusu is called to the scene of a gruesome discovery. When Owusu sends the evidence for examination, he learns the bones are connected to a cold case that left three people dead on the kitchen floor in a Chelsea mansion thirty years ago. Rachel Rimmer has also received a shock—news that her husband, Michael, has been found dead in the cellar of his house in France. All signs point to an intruder, and the French police need her to come urgently to answer questions about Michael and his past that she very much doesn’t want to answer. As they all race to discover answers to these convoluted mysteries, they will come to find that they’re connected in ways they could have never imagined. Dabney and Maggie are both fans of Lisa Jewell&#8217;s writing and are here to discuss her new book, The Family Remains. Maggie: The back blurb describes The Family Remains as a stand-alone sequel but I have to admit that I didn&#8217;t feel that way. (It&#8217;s a sequel to The Family Upstairs.) Knowing who most of these characters are and their backstory really makes a difference in how you read the tale. What do you think? Did this work as a standalone? Dabney: Well… I didn’t realize until I finished it that it was a sequel, of sorts. And I loved it! So I think, if you don’t know better, it works just fine as a standalone. That said, I suspect having read The Family Upstairs might have made for a richer reading experience. Was that the case for you? Maggie: Yes.I think otherwise some of the behaviors/events would have seemed odd or downright inexplicable.&nbsp; How would you describe these characters just based on what you learned in this text?&nbsp; Dabney: It’s true that Lucy, Henry, and Phin were all very mysterious for the first part of the book. But as someone who reads a ton of mysteries, I found that to be normal. My take was that they all had secrets I’d discover as I read which did indeed happen.&nbsp; Maggie. I think that’s a good take on it, though I would argue that in the first novel, which was more of a psychological thriller/gothic than a mystery, they all had much deeper, darker edges to them. Henry especially seemed less somehow; the Henry of the The Family Remains appears almost incapable of doing what the Henry of The Family Upstairs did. I’d also argue that there is no real mystery at the start of the novel for those of us who read that first volume. We know what happened to whom and why.&nbsp; On another note, let’s talk about the characters unique to this tale. I thought Marco was what Henry would have been if it weren’t for Henry’s horrific childhood and I absolutely loved him. Normally, youngsters that savvy drive me crazy but he was great. Rachel is another “newcomer” and I found her tale riveting. She’s so strong, resilient, and positive. A Lucy without all the darkness that has defined that woman’s life. What did you think of them? Dabney: I really enjoyed Rachel’s story – Jewel makes her actions both sympathetic and understandable. Rachel’s able to overcome her bad choices in a way that Lucy struggles to do. I liked seeing how their stories were different and yet similar. Marco was a great kid – believable and able to help his mom in interesting ways. I loved his friendship with Alf – my age group loves to bemoan how the young use technology. It was fun to see the two boys harness that power for good! Maggie: In fairness, the struggles that Lucy had to deal with in book one &#8211; which are only alluded to in much of this book &#8211; were far more severe than Rachel’s.

The point being that Arthur is at the bottom of the Great North Pack, so far out of Julia’s normal contacts yet the only one who tries to be nice to her (and pays for it, at the beginning of the story). But this also means Julia has to buck up and face some uncomfortable truths, and she really comes into her own as an individual as the story progresses. It’s also been a while for me since I read the previous book and truthfully, plot details often don’t stick with me for long from any story unless it’s one I’ve read multiple times.

It wasn’t Flynn’s first book or even her second—she’d published two unsettling works both of which had sold reasonably well. But <strong>Gone Girl</strong> rocketed to the top of the best-seller list in the summer of 2012—it spent eight weeks at #1 on the NYT hardcover list and by the end of the year had sold over two million copies. In general, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/30/books/gone-girl-by-gillian-flynn.html\">critics loved it</a> and readers couldn’t stop talking about it.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t love Flynn’s first two books—I find <strong>Sharp Objects</strong> so disturbing that, really, I wish I’d never read it and the lead sin <strong>Dark Places</strong> are too glum for my liking. But I adored <strong>Gone Girl</strong>. I am grateful I read it in the era where spoilers were easy to avoid—I can still remember gaping at the very first paragraph of Part Two. It was a book that as soon as I’d finished reading it, I wanted to do so again and, several weeks later I did. Flynn’s precision with both plot and words riveted me. Everything about the novel, including its morally ambiguous framework, worked for me.</p>\n<p>I read it again last month to see how it would hold up. And, if possible, I thought it even better.</p>\n<p>For those who haven’t read it, <strong>Gone Girl </strong>is the story of Nick and Amy Dunne whose marriage, like many, is full of lies, malice, sex, betrayal, and love. As the book begins, it is the morning of Nick and Amy’s fifth anniversary and Nick comes downstairs to find Amy making pancakes. Amy beams at Nick, calls him handsome, and Nick, full of dread, thinks “OK, go.”</p>\n<p>Within hours, Amy has vanished, the living room is in shambles, and the police—and the reader&#8211;are eyeing Nick with suspicion. After all, the most likely killer of a missing, presumably dead wife is <em>always</em> the husband. Worse, as Nick tells the story, it’s clear he might have murdered Amy. When he met her, she was perfect&#8211;beautiful, charming, and very very rich. Now, however, Amy, though still beautiful, is viciously nasty to Nick (or so he says), and all that money Nick so longed for is missing. After the money vanished, the two moved back to Nick’s small hometown in  Missouri, a place Nick says Amy loathes, and their marriage has become, according to Nick, an emotional hell.</p>\n<p>Nick’s story is in first person but the reader gets Amy’s story via her diary, a work whose first entry she penned seven years ago on the night she met Nick. In her telling, from the moment they met, she adored him. Her prose is full, in the salad days of their story, of effervescent joy. Nick was just <em>the best, coolest, most wonderful man <strong>EVER</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>Both Amy and Nick, when they met, were writers. And though neither of them is paid to do so anymore, in <strong>Gone Girl</strong> they are each determinedly telling their side of the story. The book goes back and forth between Nick narrating what (or so he says) is happening in real-time and Amy narrating what happened in the past (or so she says), in chronological order via her diary. Both narrations are utterly unreliably.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to misdirect a reader. You can leave out facts that had they been shared cast a completely different lens on the story you’re telling. You can emphasize things that in reality were meaningless at the time and now inflate them with portent. You can simply say things that are patently untrue. Amy and Nick each do all of these and more as they work to control the narrative of their love story. Because it is, while not even vaguely a romance, a love story. Amy’s and Nick’s ultimate goal is to show the world the real person the other is and the relationship they’ve wrought is as intimate as any I’ve ever read.</p>\n<p><strong>Gone Girl</strong> offers shock after shock and the plot, while at times borderline bonkers, is believable. This is a book that even on my third reading of it, I couldn’t put down. Even better is Flynn’s prose. In 2022, we all know Amy’s famous <em>Cool Girl</em> rant. It is, if possible, over twenty years even more true in its skewering of a certain kind of horribly common male expectation for women.</p>\n<div class=\"spoiler test-123\"><div class=\"spoiler-title\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Spoiler</div><div class=\"spoiler-content\" style=\"display: none;\">Being the Cool Girl means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like she’s hosting the world’s biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2, because Cool Girls are above all hot. Hot and understanding. Cool Girls never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want. Go ahead, shit on me, I don’t mind, I’m the Cool Girl.Men actually think this girl exists. Maybe they’re fooled because so many women are willing to pretend to be this girl.

Oh, and if you’re not a Cool Girl, I beg you not to believe that your man doesn’t want the Cool Girl. It may be a slightly different version—maybe he’s a vegetarian, so Cool Girl loves seitan and is great with dogs; or maybe he’s a hipster artist, so Cool Girl is a tattooed, bespectacled nerd who loves comics. There are variations to the window dressing, but believe me, he wants Cool Girl, who is basically the girl who likes every fucking thing he likes and doesn’t ever complain.

Wells books &#8211; this one, its predecessor <span class=\"a-size-extra-large\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/38xiaq3\"><strong>The Tyrant Alpha&#8217;s Rejected Mate</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/39sBvZy\"><strong>Hitting the Wall</strong></a>, and the second book in that series (</span><span id=\"productTitle\" class=\"a-size-extra-large\"><strong><em>Stonecut County</em></strong>) <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ws2bBP\"><strong>Against A Wall</strong></a>. I&#8217;ve enjoyed them all &#8211; <strong>The Tyrant Alpha&#8217;s Rejected Mate</strong> is my favorite followed by <strong>Hitting the Wall</strong>. This book isn&#8217;t as strong as either of those but I liked and can recommend it, especially as part of the <strong><em>Five Packs</em></strong> series. </span></p>\n<p><strong>The Heir Apparent&#8217;s Rejected Mate</strong> is the second book in that series which features five different but connected wolf shifter packs. The pack in book one is the Quarry Pack which shuns human contact as much as possible. This book features the Moon Lake Pack, a pack that tries to be as human as possible based on the belief that the best way to survive with humans is to beat them at their own games. I confess to liking the dynamics of the Quarry Pack better than those of the Moon Lake Pack&#8211;the latter is less interesting simply because their motivations and thoughts are, in large part, very similar to our own.</p>\n<p>Every paranormal world has its rules and in that of the Five Packs, the rule is that females choose their mates. Or rather their bodies choose&#8211;a female, when it&#8217;s time for her to go into heat, is suddenly triggered by the presence of her mate. From that moment on, until they mate which, yes, means just what you think it does, she&#8217;s repulsed by all other males and increasingly physically miserable. In both books, nature, the cruel matchmaker she is, pairs a female of very low rank with the leader of the pack who&#8230; promptly rejects her because she&#8217;s of very low rank. But a rule is a rule so, in each book, our star-crossed lovers have to figure out how to be together. Really, what happens is the stupid males too sold on their specialness come to realize the chick who has chosen them is perfect, not just for them but for the fate of the pack.</p>\n<p>Wells&#8217; heroes are, to a man, less interesting than her heroines. The male leads in the books that I&#8217;ve read&#8211;with the exception of Cash, from <strong>Against the Wall</strong>, are the leaders of their community, large and very strong, handsome, and somewhat clueless about what women want. I find them sexy&#8211;what can I say? There&#8217;s no accounting for taste!&#8211;but I&#8217;d much rather be in the heads of the Wells&#8217; females all of who are fascinating. (All the books are narrated in dual voice.)</p>\n<p>Rosie, this book&#8217;s low status lead, is a scavenger. In the Moon Lake Pack, the pack hierarchy is based on wealth and power. And, just like it is in the real world, those with money and power tend to think that those without just don&#8217;t try hard enough. The scavenger class is seen as the welfare class&#8211;they&#8217;re not smart enough or human enough or motivated enough to hold the human jobs the nobs in the pack do and they&#8217;re grudgingly supported with &#8220;donations.&#8221;  Rosie and her friends&#8211;Wells does friend groups beautifully&#8211;spend their time scavenging, hunting for things they can use and trade, and, in general, being there for one another.</p>\n<p>Rosie mostly scavenges for herbs.

                "text": "I&#8217;ve read four of Cate C. Wells books &#8211; this one, its predecessor The Tyrant Alpha&#8217;s Rejected Mate, Hitting the Wall, and the second book in that series (Stonecut County) Against A Wall. I&#8217;ve enjoyed them all &#8211; The Tyrant Alpha&#8217;s Rejected Mate is my favorite followed by Hitting the Wall. This book isn&#8217;t as strong as either of those but I liked and can recommend it, especially as part of the Five Packs series. The Heir Apparent&#8217;s Rejected Mate is the second book in that series which features five different but connected wolf shifter packs. The pack in book one is the Quarry Pack which shuns human contact as much as possible. This book features the Moon Lake Pack, a pack that tries to be as human as possible based on the belief that the best way to survive with humans is to beat them at their own games. I confess to liking the dynamics of the Quarry Pack better than those of the Moon Lake Pack&#8211;the latter is less interesting simply because their motivations and thoughts are, in large part, very similar to our own. Every paranormal world has its rules and in that of the Five Packs, the rule is that females choose their mates. Or rather their bodies choose&#8211;a female, when it&#8217;s time for her to go into heat, is suddenly triggered by the presence of her mate. From that moment on, until they mate which, yes, means just what you think it does, she&#8217;s repulsed by all other males and increasingly physically miserable. In both books, nature, the cruel matchmaker she is, pairs a female of very low rank with the leader of the pack who&#8230; promptly rejects her because she&#8217;s of very low rank. But a rule is a rule so, in each book, our star-crossed lovers have to figure out how to be together. Really, what happens is the stupid males too sold on their specialness come to realize the chick who has chosen them is perfect, not just for them but for the fate of the pack. Wells&#8217; heroes are, to a man, less interesting than her heroines. The male leads in the books that I&#8217;ve read&#8211;with the exception of Cash, from Against the Wall, are the leaders of their community, large and very strong, handsome, and somewhat clueless about what women want. I find them sexy&#8211;what can I say? There&#8217;s no accounting for taste!&#8211;but I&#8217;d much rather be in the heads of the Wells&#8217; females all of who are fascinating. (All the books are narrated in dual voice.) Rosie, this book&#8217;s low status lead, is a scavenger. In the Moon Lake Pack, the pack hierarchy is based on wealth and power. And, just like it is in the real world, those with money and power tend to think that those without just don&#8217;t try hard enough. The scavenger class is seen as the welfare class&#8211;they&#8217;re not smart enough or human enough or motivated enough to hold the human jobs the nobs in the pack do and they&#8217;re grudgingly supported with &#8220;donations.&#8221;  Rosie and her friends&#8211;Wells does friend groups beautifully&#8211;spend their time scavenging, hunting for things they can use and trade, and, in general, being there for one another. Rosie mostly scavenges for herbs. The pack&#8217;s witch&#8211;they&#8217;re supposed to call her a wise woman but hardly any does&#8211;the fabulous Abertha, chose Rosie as her apprentice when Rosie was a child. Years of combing the woods&#8211;Rosie has developed a grid system&#8211;for ashbalm, dragon&#8217;s tongue, and wolf&#8217;s bane have given her a deep connection to the land the Moon Lake pack occupies. She loves her family and is happy with her life until the day fate completely f*cks her over and pairs her with Cadoc Collins, the Moon Pack&#8217;s eventual leader&#8211;his father is the pack&#8217;s acting regent.

Three years later, when we reviewed <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/watcher-in-the-woods-by-kelley-armstrong/\"><strong>Watcher in the Woods</strong></a> I downloaded the book but didn&#8217;t get to it. Finally, last summer, after readers in the forum mentioned how much they loved the <em>Casey Duncan/Rockton</em> series, I downloaded book one&#8211;<strong>City of the Lost</strong>&#8212; and was entranced. I read all seven books&#8211;the final book in the series came out in February&#8211;and enjoyed them all individually and as a series.</p>\n<p>What do I love about the <em>Rockton</em> series?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWC3p2FwLkA\">To begin with, everything.</a></p>\n<p>Imagine a town, created decades ago in the remote Yukon, where people who need to disappear can. This city, Rockton, is cloaked and essentially invisible&#8211;there&#8217;s no electricity, no computers, phones, or internet, no mail. Rockton only admits people who have a skill the town can use or&#8211;and this is something the reader learns over time&#8211;who have paid a vast sum to the Council, the shadowy remote group who controls the town. Rockton is in large part self-sustaining and civilized, unlike the areas around it which are peopled by other more primitive groups one of which, the hostiles, are terrifying.</p>\n<p>In book one, <strong>City of the Lost</strong>, a young woman named Casey Duncan comes to Rockton with her friend Diana. Both are escaping violent pasts. Diana, however, hasn&#8217;t any real skill to bring to town but Casey does. Rockton has just one sherriff, Eric Dalton and he&#8217;s been unable to solve a series of killings that have recently occurred in Rockton. Casey is a homicide detective and is professionally trained, something Eric who was born in Rockton is not.</p>\n<p>Over the seven books in the series, Armstrong keeps the suspense and the tension coming. I love good long plot arcs and this series has many. Who are the hostiles and why are they so violent? What is the true story behind Dalton&#8217;s childhood? Who is the Council and what are their motives? Is Rockton made up of criminals, victims, or both? Incorporated into these plotlines, in each book, is a specific mystery, several of which I was riveted by and couldn&#8217;t see the denouncements until they arrived upon the page.</p>\n<p>Armstrong also excels at character. Rockton is a small place and we get to know many characters, none of whom are quite what they seem.

                "text": "there are mild spoilers for the first six books in this review In 2016, I read our review of City of the Lost by Kelley Armstrong, thought, that looks interesting and promptly forgot about it. Three years later, when we reviewed Watcher in the Woods I downloaded the book but didn&#8217;t get to it. Finally, last summer, after readers in the forum mentioned how much they loved the Casey Duncan/Rockton series, I downloaded book one&#8211;City of the Lost&#8212; and was entranced. I read all seven books&#8211;the final book in the series came out in February&#8211;and enjoyed them all individually and as a series. What do I love about the Rockton series? To begin with, everything. Imagine a town, created decades ago in the remote Yukon, where people who need to disappear can. This city, Rockton, is cloaked and essentially invisible&#8211;there&#8217;s no electricity, no computers, phones, or internet, no mail. Rockton only admits people who have a skill the town can use or&#8211;and this is something the reader learns over time&#8211;who have paid a vast sum to the Council, the shadowy remote group who controls the town. Rockton is in large part self-sustaining and civilized, unlike the areas around it which are peopled by other more primitive groups one of which, the hostiles, are terrifying. In book one, City of the Lost, a young woman named Casey Duncan comes to Rockton with her friend Diana. Both are escaping violent pasts. Diana, however, hasn&#8217;t any real skill to bring to town but Casey does. Rockton has just one sherriff, Eric Dalton and he&#8217;s been unable to solve a series of killings that have recently occurred in Rockton. Casey is a homicide detective and is professionally trained, something Eric who was born in Rockton is not. Over the seven books in the series, Armstrong keeps the suspense and the tension coming. I love good long plot arcs and this series has many. Who are the hostiles and why are they so violent? What is the true story behind Dalton&#8217;s childhood? Who is the Council and what are their motives? Is Rockton made up of criminals, victims, or both? Incorporated into these plotlines, in each book, is a specific mystery, several of which I was riveted by and couldn&#8217;t see the denouncements until they arrived upon the page. Armstrong also excels at character. Rockton is a small place and we get to know many characters, none of whom are quite what they seem. I am especially fond of Isabel, the brothel owner, Mathias, the butcher, and Jacob the, well, I&#8217;ll let you learn that on your own. All the books are built upon the relationship between Casey and Dalton which is a romantic suspense reader&#8217;s dream. The final book in the series, The Deepest of Secrets, answers all the questions the series posed. The story about the hostiles is especially well resolved as is the true motives of the Council. It&#8217;s also an interesting story about privacy and our pasts&#8211;Armstrong wants the reader to consider who we are: The person in our worst moments or the person in our everyday actions? What happens, in a small town where secrets are necessary in order for the community to function, when those secrets all spill out? And who would we ally with? Those who&#8217;ve had our back recently or those whose backstories we feel the safest with? If you are looking for a smart, addictive, romantic suspense series, the Rockton novels are for you.

My husband is a plastic surgeon who, for the first twenty years of his career was&#8230; at a teaching hospital and whose practice was half reconstructive/half aesthetic cases. I have <em>lived</em> academic plastic surgery. And this book&#8230; well, it gets about half of it right. This made me mildly crazy. But, that&#8217;s just me.

Its roof terrace is so discreet, you wouldn’t know it existed if you weren’t standing at the window of the flat directly opposite. But you are. And that’s when you see a man up there—a man you’d recognize anywhere. He may be older now, but it’s definitely him.</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But that can’t be because he’s been dead for over two years. You know this for a fact.</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because you’re the one who killed him</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dabney and Maggie read Louise Candlish&#8217;s </span><b>The Heights</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, then (virtually) got together to discuss the novel and are here to share their thoughts.</span></p>\n<p><b>Maggie:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Something that I love about the current suspense/thriller/mystery market is that the characters are clever, nuanced and surprising. Almost every novel you pick up has this in common. Candlish is different. Having read her previous work, I know to expect three characters from her  &#8211; one selfish jackass, one naive but earnest damaged individual and one middle-aged man who desperately wants to pretend he&#8217;s in his twenties and sleeps with younger women.  She uses them effectively but they are always present. All three of those stock characters are easily identified in this novel. What is your experience with Candlish and would you agree those characters make an appearance here?</span></p>\n<p><b>Dabney: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is my first Candlish and, after what you&#8217;ve said, I&#8217;m grateful for that. None of these characters felt stock to me. In fact, I&#8217;m not sure who would be who in your first two characterizations! I found Ellen, whom I describe as the main character, mesmerizing and unique. Her particular combination of rage, self-awareness, and intelligence was blazingly compelling to me. I&#8217;m guessing you see her as the earnest damaged individual? I&#8217;d argue she is, in her own way, a selfish jackass. But perhaps we are getting ahead of ourselves. What did you think about the plot?</span></p>\n<p><b>Maggie</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: I loved the plot ! It captures a lot of factors about modern family life really well in spite of its deeply atypical premise . Ellen epitomizes the way the modern mom feels &#8211; we are pressured to helicopter parent, to make sure our kids are achieving optimum performance scholastically while also having meaningful after-school activities (music, dance,sports etc.)  and yet we are also expected to give them a great deal of freedom, to know when to stop hovering over them and allow them to spread their wings. It&#8217;s an extremely stressful tightrope to walk on and I empathized a lot with Ellen. She&#8217;s also symbolic of the pressures of co-parenting with an ex, that difficulty of getting them to agree on what is best for the child and carry through with the agreed-upon rules and boundaries. I didn&#8217;t find her selfish at all &#8211; tired, stressed and a devoted mother but not selfish. She also characterizes every mother&#8217;s deepest fear, that everything we do isn&#8217;t enough to keep bad things from happening to our kids or bad people from influencing them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What did you think of the plot/premise? </span></p>\n<p><b>Dabney:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I, too, thought it was fabulous. You know, from the beginning, that something terrible happened to Ellen and her family and that she blames someone she thought was dead. Ellen&#8217;s loathing for this man is visceral: </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kieran Watts is the monster who destroyed my life. Whose actions will torment my soul until my dying day, and perhaps even beyond—I wouldn’t put it past him.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ellen thinks he&#8217;s dead because she claims she killed him and yet suddenly, while standing in a client&#8217;s home in London, she sees him, standing on the penthouse deck of the apartment across the street. Ellen&#8217;s hatred for Kieran is visceral and, once she&#8217;s seen him, she is determined to find him and make sure that, this time, he pays for what he did to her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To say that Ellen is obsessed with Kieran is to miswrite.Since the moment Kieran became friends with her son Lucas, seven years ago, Ellen has been sure that Kieran is, as you wrote, a selfish dangerous jackass whose friendship with Lucas is ruining her son. And, as the book goes back and forth between today and seven years ago, we don&#8217;t really know if Ellen&#8217;s right about Kieran or if Ellen&#8217;s obsession keeps her from seeing Lucas, Kieran, and Lucas&#8217; sister Klara clearly. It&#8217;s mesmerizing.</span></p>\n<p><b>Maggie:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It is mesmerizing, although I think the last several chapters show us the truth pretty clearly. That is another aspect of the thriller market I love right now  &#8211; pages and pages of uncertainty and then shocking clarity. It&#8217;s seductive and addictive. You mentioned Kieran, a disadvantaged teenage boy who earns a scholarship to a posh academy. He could easily have been a boring, clichéd caricature but seen through Ellen&#8217;s eyes he becomes an almost other-worldly harbinger of evil. How did you feel Candlish handled that aspect of the plot?</span></p>\n<p><b>Dabney:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Parents do not see their teenage children with clarity and, man, did I think that applied to Ellen. Part of the great fun of the novel is trying to figure out what is and isn&#8217;t true in Ellen&#8217;s narration which, we should add, takes up most but not all of the book. Candlish doesn&#8217;t make it easy to sympathize with Ellen consistently&#8211;her rage has warped her and, at times, makes her what may or may not be crazy. Is Kieran evil? Was he evil in the past but now should be forgiven? Who is the psychopath: myopic, enraged Ellen, Kieran the boy, Kieran the man, or some combination therein? I couldn&#8217;t put the book down because I so needed to know the answer to that question!</span></p>\n<p><b>Maggie:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This actually touches on two of the triggers I found in the book. One is harm to children/young adults &#8211; if you are sensitive to that, this probably isn&#8217;t the novel for you. The second is a phenomenon I call &#8220;Bitches Be Crazy&#8221; and which has been in existence in the Western world for many centuries. It&#8217;s the premise that strong emotions in women are a sign of unbalance &#8211; we are hysterical, obsessed, manic, unhinged. Most women have probably been told to &#8220;calm down&#8221; at least once in their life because we aren&#8217;t allowed any excess display of emotion. I thought Vic, the middle-aged guy who tries so hard to be &#8220;cool&#8221;, labels Ellen this way a lot, as do her daughter and husband. What did you think of the character of Vic? And did the book have any triggers for you?</span></p>\n<p><b>Dabney:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I am a trigger-free reader although extreme violence to kids is tough for me to read. So, no to that question!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for Vic, I thought he was portrayed as someone we are supposed to know is a loser&#8211;I still can&#8217;t figure out what his wife sees in him. And, again, Ellen does need to calm the f*ck down. Her rage is ruinous and not just for her. One of the things I found especially unlikable about Ellen is how sure she is that her perceptions are THE RIGHT ones. She wouldn&#8217;t listen to anyone, not even those she loved and she knew loved her.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I really enjoyed </span><b>The Heights</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> tremendously even though I found Ellen, Kieran, and Vic all hard to root for. And I think that says something about how well Candlish writes&#8211;I usually don&#8217;t like books where I don&#8217;t like anyone but in this case, it didn&#8217;t bother me. Did you like the book?</span></p>\n<p><b>Maggie:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I enjoyed the book but with a caveat. I&#8217;ve heard other readers mention that they struggled to get past the beginning and I agree that this is a book you have to settle into. At the twenty percent mark the author says &#8220;keep reading &#8211; because we&#8217;re almost there&#8221; and I can remember wanting to scream at my Kindle <em>&#8220;Are we??&#8221;</em> because I felt like it was taking  a bit too long to get where we were going. Once we were past the precipitating event, the story picked up and was very much what I expected from today&#8217;s thriller market.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>In terms of grading, I would give it a B+/A-</strong>. The book is fabulous once the story really gets going but it does lag a bit between the gripping beginning and the backstory that returns us to that point. What grade would you give it? </span></p>\n<p><b>Dabney</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: <strong>I too would give it at B+/A-</strong>. And, interestingly, for the exact opposite reason. I thought the weakest part of the book was the resolution and the post-resolution exposition. The first 90% of the book is a DIK read for me, but the end just wasn’t quite what I wanted.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Buy it at: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/34fUjZS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3rtJKuY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Audible</a> or your <a href=\"https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781982174125?aff=allaboutromance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">local independent retailer</a></strong></h3>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Visit our <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2SeEiZg\">Amazon Storefront</a></strong></h3>\n",

Her particular combination of rage, self-awareness, and intelligence was blazingly compelling to me. I&#8217;m guessing you see her as the earnest damaged individual? I&#8217;d argue she is, in her own way, a selfish jackass. But perhaps we are getting ahead of ourselves. What did you think about the plot? Maggie: I loved the plot ! It captures a lot of factors about modern family life really well in spite of its deeply atypical premise . Ellen epitomizes the way the modern mom feels &#8211; we are pressured to helicopter parent, to make sure our kids are achieving optimum performance scholastically while also having meaningful after-school activities (music, dance,sports etc.)  and yet we are also expected to give them a great deal of freedom, to know when to stop hovering over them and allow them to spread their wings. It&#8217;s an extremely stressful tightrope to walk on and I empathized a lot with Ellen. She&#8217;s also symbolic of the pressures of co-parenting with an ex, that difficulty of getting them to agree on what is best for the child and carry through with the agreed-upon rules and boundaries. I didn&#8217;t find her selfish at all &#8211; tired, stressed and a devoted mother but not selfish. She also characterizes every mother&#8217;s deepest fear, that everything we do isn&#8217;t enough to keep bad things from happening to our kids or bad people from influencing them.  What did you think of the plot/premise?  Dabney: I, too, thought it was fabulous. You know, from the beginning, that something terrible happened to Ellen and her family and that she blames someone she thought was dead. Ellen&#8217;s loathing for this man is visceral:  Kieran Watts is the monster who destroyed my life. Whose actions will torment my soul until my dying day, and perhaps even beyond—I wouldn’t put it past him. Ellen thinks he&#8217;s dead because she claims she killed him and yet suddenly, while standing in a client&#8217;s home in London, she sees him, standing on the penthouse deck of the apartment across the street. Ellen&#8217;s hatred for Kieran is visceral and, once she&#8217;s seen him, she is determined to find him and make sure that, this time, he pays for what he did to her.  To say that Ellen is obsessed with Kieran is to miswrite.Since the moment Kieran became friends with her son Lucas, seven years ago, Ellen has been sure that Kieran is, as you wrote, a selfish dangerous jackass whose friendship with Lucas is ruining her son. And, as the book goes back and forth between today and seven years ago, we don&#8217;t really know if Ellen&#8217;s right about Kieran or if Ellen&#8217;s obsession keeps her from seeing Lucas, Kieran, and Lucas&#8217; sister Klara clearly. It&#8217;s mesmerizing. Maggie: It is mesmerizing, although I think the last several chapters show us the truth pretty clearly. That is another aspect of the thriller market I love right now  &#8211; pages and pages of uncertainty and then shocking clarity. It&#8217;s seductive and addictive. You mentioned Kieran, a disadvantaged teenage boy who earns a scholarship to a posh academy. He could easily have been a boring, clichéd caricature but seen through Ellen&#8217;s eyes he becomes an almost other-worldly harbinger of evil. How did you feel Candlish handled that aspect of the plot? Dabney: Parents do not see their teenage children with clarity and, man, did I think that applied to Ellen. Part of the great fun of the novel is trying to figure out what is and isn&#8217;t true in Ellen&#8217;s narration which, we should add, takes up most but not all of the book. Candlish doesn&#8217;t make it easy to sympathize with Ellen consistently&#8211;her rage has warped her and, at times, makes her what may or may not be crazy. Is Kieran evil? Was he evil in the past but now should be forgiven? Who is the psychopath: myopic, enraged Ellen, Kieran the boy, Kieran the man, or some combination therein? I couldn&#8217;t put the book down because I so needed to know the answer to that question! Maggie: This actually touches on two of the triggers I found in the book. One is harm to children/young adults &#8211; if you are sensitive to that, this probably isn&#8217;t the novel for you. The second is a phenomenon I call &#8220;Bitches Be Crazy&#8221; and which has been in existence in the Western world for many centuries. It&#8217;s the premise that strong emotions in women are a sign of unbalance &#8211; we are hysterical, obsessed, manic, unhinged. Most women have probably been told to &#8220;calm down&#8221; at least once in their life because we aren&#8217;t allowed any excess display of emotion. I thought Vic, the middle-aged guy who tries so hard to be &#8220;cool&#8221;, labels Ellen this way a lot, as do her daughter and husband. What did you think of the character of Vic? And did the book have any triggers for you? Dabney: I am a trigger-free reader although extreme violence to kids is tough for me to read. So, no to that question! As for Vic, I thought he was portrayed as someone we are supposed to know is a loser&#8211;I still can&#8217;t figure out what his wife sees in him. And, again, Ellen does need to calm the f*ck down. Her rage is ruinous and not just for her. One of the things I found especially unlikable about Ellen is how sure she is that her perceptions are THE RIGHT ones. She wouldn&#8217;t listen to anyone, not even those she loved and she knew loved her. I really enjoyed The Heights tremendously even though I found Ellen, Kieran, and Vic all hard to root for. And I think that says something about how well Candlish writes&#8211;I usually don&#8217;t like books where I don&#8217;t like anyone but in this case, it didn&#8217;t bother me. Did you like the book? Maggie: I enjoyed the book but with a caveat. I&#8217;ve heard other readers mention that they struggled to get past the beginning and I agree that this is a book you have to settle into. At the twenty percent mark the author says &#8220;keep reading &#8211; because we&#8217;re almost there&#8221; and I can remember wanting to scream at my Kindle &#8220;Are we??&#8221; because I felt like it was taking  a bit too long to get where we were going. Once we were past the precipitating event, the story picked up and was very much what I expected from today&#8217;s thriller market. In terms of grading, I would give it a B+/A-. The book is fabulous once the story really gets going but it does lag a bit between the gripping beginning and the backstory that returns us to that point. What grade would you give it?  Dabney: I too would give it at B+/A-. And, interestingly, for the exact opposite reason. I thought the weakest part of the book was the resolution and the post-resolution exposition. The first 90% of the book is a DIK read for me, but the end just wasn’t quite what I wanted.

How about you? </span></p>\n<p><b>Maria Rose:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I&#8217;ve read them all too. I have to say I enjoyed this one the best of the three so far, but I think that&#8217;s because I&#8217;m in a better reading frame of mind this year than I was in 2021. I found it difficult to enjoy reading in general at certain points of the year (for pandemic and other reasons) so authors that I normally look forward to reading (such as Serena Bell) didn&#8217;t hold the same luster that they usually do. But I&#8217;m happy to say that my reading mojo is back and as a result, this &#8216;fake relationship turns real&#8217; romance kept me quite entertained. I think I&#8217;m also a sucker for heroes like Clark who show their protective side (without doing it in a alpha-hole way).  </span></p>\n<p><b>Dabney:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Interesting. This is actually my least favorite of the three! I enjoyed it&#8211;Bell is one of the best contemporary romance writers around and she&#8217;s always genuinely funny&#8211;but Jessa and Clark&#8217;s fake dating/real f*cking thing made no sense to me. I also think&#8211;and this is a somewhat unfair criticism&#8211;that Clark&#8217;s dedication to his dead wife is uncomfortably close to to Sawyer&#8217;s, the hero of my favorite Bell book </span><strong><a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/sleepover-by-serena-bell/\">Sleepover</a></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I think she did that trope better in <strong>Sleepover</strong> so this book&#8217;s barrier to love felt wan to me. </span></p>\n<p><b>Maria Rose: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I&#8217;m terrible at remembering characters from other books so I had to check Goodreads to see if I&#8217;d read </span><b>Sleepover</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (I haven&#8217;t) so I don&#8217;t have a comparison with it.  I think the concept of pretending to be in a relationship but having real sex gives the characters the chance to act on their attraction to each other without having to think of what that really means in the long term &#8211; it&#8217;s sex without emotional consequences. And since neither Jessa nor Clark is ready to consider having another committed relationship (Jessa because her marriage has recently broken up and Clark having lost his wife), it&#8217;s an easy way out for them.  Of course, the sex scenes are always fun to read in a Bell book too </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><b>Dabney:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Agree–Bell does love scenes really well. And don’t get me wrong, I enjoyed this book. It just didn’t wow me. If you think of it as a romantic comedy, I felt the comedy was stellar and the romance was just fine. And while I always like checking in with the other Wilders, there was a bit much of them in this book–I found them almost overwhelming. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also had two other small issues with the book. One was the reveal about Barb seemed to me to be a bit odd–it sort of felt like checking a box than something that was intrinsic to what we know about the character. I also really didn’t, as someone who works in medicine, understand the thing that killed Clark’s wife. It wasn’t well explained and didn’t hold up to scrutiny. I just don’t get why authors don’t do a better job of vetting medical things!</span></p>\n<p><b>Maria Rose: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I agree with you about Barb, I didn’t think the clues were really there to come up with that reveal (no spoilers!).  As for Clark’s wife Emma’s death, it made his overreaction to events later with Jessa make more sense but it was a somewhat vague way to remove the character. In the end though, the reasons for her death don’t matter as much as how Clark has dealt with it (or not dealt with it in this case). It was good to see him reach a catharsis and those scenes with him and Emma’s mom made me tearful.  I definitely noticed that this series in general is more lighthearted and funny than her <em><strong>Returning Home</strong></em> series which deals with a lot of trauma (though they are some of my favourites by her). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was fine with all the family interaction (and as you said there is a lot of it). The Wilders are a big family of siblings and with some of the earlier series characters getting married in this one, I’d expect a lot of interaction with them. It’s given us an interesting heads up into Kane’s book too! </span></p>\n<p><b>Dabney</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: I’m hopeful for Kane given that Easton’s love story has been staring us in the face since day one. I hope there’s more to it than just enemies who secretly love each other! Kane’s book looks like a secret baby book– it will be fun to see what Bell does with that trope!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I really do love reading about the Wilders – they’re such a loving, funny family. This book isn’t my favorite of the series but it was still a fun, sexy read.

What did you decide on for a grade? </span></p>\n<p><b>Dabney</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: <strong>This is a B for me.</strong> It’s a fun, strong story, just not quite into DIK territory for me.

She left no word of where she was headed and her cellphone, purse, and car are all sitting at home. Has she been killed? And if so, did Stan do it? After all, he has scratches on his face and an unhelpful manner. Do his children suspect him? Are they protecting him? What do they know&#8211;because they obviously know something&#8211;that they&#8217;re not telling the police? And how does Savannah, the mysterious young woman who stayed a few weeks with Stan and Joy earlier in the year, figure into it all?</p>\n<p>This is the ostensible plot of the latest headed-for-the-big/small-screen novel by Australia&#8217;s best-selling author Liane Moriarty. But if Joy&#8217;s disappearance is the kernel of the film, the flesh of this story is that of the Delaney family. I couldn&#8217;t get enough of them; each is so fully formed and fallible I could have successfully bought them each a Christmas gift they&#8217;d have loved.*</p>\n<p>The novel lays out the lives of the Delaneys-it goes back and forth in time like all Moriarty&#8217;s books&#8211;in reverent detail. We see Stan and Joy as children&#8211;they were in the very top tier of Aussie tennis players at very young ages&#8211;as young passionate lovers, as exhausted parents, as successful business partners in on of Australia&#8217;s most venerated tennis schools, all the way through to their 50th Valentine&#8217;s Day together&#8211;it&#8217;s the last day anyone heard from Joy. Their kids too are limned through Moriarty&#8217;s crisp, descriptive prose and their secrets and dreams resonate with realism.</p>\n<p>I liked Savannah, the perhaps villainess of the story, less. Like many psychopathic liars, she&#8217;s a blurry protagonist and one I found hard to believe in. That said, the way Savannah understands the Delaneys and uses their best impulses against them is great fun to read mostly because the Delaneys are wonderfully and precisely fascinating.</p>\n<p>As I listened to this story&#8211;Caroline Lee&#8217;s narration is a knock-out&#8211;I wondered at where these six people would land. Did Stan murder Joy? (This is the conviction of the dogged detective on his trail, a long-suffering young woman named Christina Khoury whose determination to see Joy&#8217;s disappearance as a crime is obviously understandable.) Will Amy, the oldest and most offbeat Delaney child, ever get her shit together and see the love right under her eyes? Will Troy decided to let his ex-wife whom he still loves implant the embryos they made when they were still married so that she and her new husband can have a baby? Will Brooke&#8217;s physiotherapy practice succeed better than her marriage? Will Logan win back the heart of Indira or subdue the low-level jealousy he harbors towards his brother&#8217;s successes ? And, most importantly, will Joy, whose love, determination, and sheer verve have ruled her own family for years, get the future she deserves or is she yet another victim of suburban violence?</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll want to know the answers to these questions badly. And, with the exception of the very last chapter which I am convinced was written with an eye toward the novel&#8217;s inevitable filming, I loved the resolution to these stories. The novel is hopeful and, even better, clear eyed on the necessary compromises one makes for family and for love. <strong>Apples Never Fall</strong> is my favorite of Moriarty&#8217;s work&#8211;read it before it hits the screen.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Buy it at: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3FUSP5a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3sRklMU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Audible</a> or your <a href=\"https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250220271?aff=allaboutromance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">local independent retailer</a></strong></h3>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Visit our <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2SeEiZg\">Amazon Storefront</a></strong></h3>\n<p>*Delaney gift list:</p>\n<p>for <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3zgxbpo\">Joy</a></p>\n<p>for <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3sMJMiV\">Stan</a></p>\n<p>for <a href=\"https://amzn.to/32VoIvr\">Amy</a></p>\n<p>for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Monogrammed-Gifts-Women-Personalized-Engraved/dp/B01HPQ8DXM/ref=sxin_12_pa_sp_search_thematic_sspa?crid=19599BQ8AQZJ8&amp;cv_ct_cx=wine%2Bglass%2Bset&amp;keywords=wine%2Bglass%2Bset&amp;pd_rd_i=B01HPQ9BWO&amp;pd_rd_r=655fac49-2c8f-4ce8-832b-7c56df8f9359&amp;pd_rd_w=WN63k&amp;pd_rd_wg=fOWWB&amp;pf_rd_p=4ad71b32-b810-4124-8735-d02a39478d0c&amp;pf_rd_r=YQW2EB0HGF0BPJ61V99E&amp;qid=1641144885&amp;sprefix=wine%2Bglass%2B%2Caps%2C76&amp;sr=1-1-a73d1c8c-2fd2-4f19-aa41-2df022bcb241-spons&amp;smid=A2GP3964Y64K0P&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUE2V0dJRTFMQzdFRjImZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTAyMTEyNDIxR1EzS0VPTFhZSjlRJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA5NjU1MDkxRVJOTUwyQjkwSTU3JndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3Bfc2VhcmNoX3RoZW1hdGljJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ&amp;th=1\">Brooke</a></p>\n<p>for <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3qDFpE9\">Logan</a></p>\n<p>for <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3pMEAtx\">Troy</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

We see Stan and Joy as children&#8211;they were in the very top tier of Aussie tennis players at very young ages&#8211;as young passionate lovers, as exhausted parents, as successful business partners in on of Australia&#8217;s most venerated tennis schools, all the way through to their 50th Valentine&#8217;s Day together&#8211;it&#8217;s the last day anyone heard from Joy. Their kids too are limned through Moriarty&#8217;s crisp, descriptive prose and their secrets and dreams resonate with realism. I liked Savannah, the perhaps villainess of the story, less. Like many psychopathic liars, she&#8217;s a blurry protagonist and one I found hard to believe in. That said, the way Savannah understands the Delaneys and uses their best impulses against them is great fun to read mostly because the Delaneys are wonderfully and precisely fascinating. As I listened to this story&#8211;Caroline Lee&#8217;s narration is a knock-out&#8211;I wondered at where these six people would land. Did Stan murder Joy? (This is the conviction of the dogged detective on his trail, a long-suffering young woman named Christina Khoury whose determination to see Joy&#8217;s disappearance as a crime is obviously understandable.) Will Amy, the oldest and most offbeat Delaney child, ever get her shit together and see the love right under her eyes? Will Troy decided to let his ex-wife whom he still loves implant the embryos they made when they were still married so that she and her new husband can have a baby? Will Brooke&#8217;s physiotherapy practice succeed better than her marriage? Will Logan win back the heart of Indira or subdue the low-level jealousy he harbors towards his brother&#8217;s successes ? And, most importantly, will Joy, whose love, determination, and sheer verve have ruled her own family for years, get the future she deserves or is she yet another victim of suburban violence? You&#8217;ll want to know the answers to these questions badly. And, with the exception of the very last chapter which I am convinced was written with an eye toward the novel&#8217;s inevitable filming, I loved the resolution to these stories. The novel is hopeful and, even better, clear eyed on the necessary compromises one makes for family and for love. Apples Never Fall is my favorite of Moriarty&#8217;s work&#8211;read it before it hits the screen.

Moriarty fears that tragedy has befallen his daughter and wants Charlotte to find out the truth.</p>\n<p>Charlotte and Mrs. Watson travel to a remote community of occult practitioners where Moriarty&#8217;s daughter was last seen, a place full of lies and liars. Meanwhile, Charlotte’s sister Livia tries to make sense of a mysterious message from her beau Mr. Marbleton. And Charlotte’s longtime friend and ally Lord Ingram at last turns his seductive prowess on Charlotte—or is it the other way around?</p>\n<p>But the more secrets Charlotte unravels about Miss Moriarty’s disappearance, the more she wonders why Moriarty has entrusted this delicate matter to her of all people. Is it merely to test Charlotte&#8217;s skills as an investigator, or has the man of shadows trapped her in a nest of vipers?</p></blockquote>\n<p>The game is &#8211; once again &#8211; very much afoot in this sixth installment in Sherry Thomas’ <strong><em>Lady Sherlock </em></strong>series of clever historical mysteries.  As the synopsis indicates, she finally comes face-to-face with her nemesis &#8211; but rather than the expected violent confrontation, ‘Mr. Baxter’ instead wants to engage Holmes’ services to investigate the disappearance of his daughter from a Hermetic (possibly occultist) community in a remote corner of Cornwall.  Of course, Charlotte knows not to take anything at face value, but with no other options available, Charlotte, Lord Ingram and Mrs. Watson head for the Garden of Hermopolis to see what they can find out.  In the meantime, Charlotte’s sister, Livia, is following an intriguing trail of breadcrumbs left by Stephen Marbleton that leads to some very intriguing coded messages which could prove vital in the fight against Moriarty.</p>\n<p>Caz and Dabney are both massive Sherry Thomas fans and have followed the series since day one &#8211; although their opinions over the last couple of books have diverged.  They both read <strong>Miss Moriarty, I Presume?</strong> and are here to share their thoughts about the novel.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Caz: </strong>Dabney, I know I’ve enjoyed the last couple of <strong><em>Lady Sherlock</em></strong> books a bit more than you have &#8211; but much as it pains me to say it, even <em>I</em> found this one to be a bit of a slog.  None of the books really work as standalones, and that’s especially true of <strong>Miss Moriarty</strong>, which feels like a culmination of all that has gone before.  There are lots of references to events and characters from previous books, but while I was pleased to see all the puzzle pieces being drawn together, I did at times struggle to recall all the whos, whats whens and whys &#8211; and it made for a pretty dense read.</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney: </strong>I want to love this series, I do. And the first two were fabulous and the third quite good but since then, well, I’m losing interest. Each of the last three books has required recalling <em>in detail </em>the preceding books, to the point that without my Kindle’s search feature, I’d have been lost. The plotting is, as you say, dense and the story arcs of the series &#8211; Charlotte and Ash, Moriarty’s true aims, Livia and Mr. Marbleton &#8211; are leisurely. At this point, I’m hoping she’ll speed up these resolutions and move on. The adage <em>all good things must come to an end</em> resonates for a reason.</p>\n<p><strong>Caz: </strong> I agree that there’s been a loss of momentum over the past book or two.  I haven’t found it too much of a problem to be able to recall the plot details I needed to follow each book, but this time around?  Yeah, I was reading things and thinking <em>“I know I should know why this is important…”</em> but couldn’t always remember why, and that was frustrating.  Maybe that’s a failure on my part, but even though I follow a number of mystery series that require some knowledge of what went before, I struggled here.  There were things I liked a lot, but as a whole, I found <strong>Miss Moriarty, I Presume?</strong> to be tough going.  The first half is pretty slow &#8211; actually, the first two-thirds or so is slow &#8211; although fortunately, it did pick up later in the second half and reached a satisfying conclusion.  Although there is clearly more to come.</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: I too follow several long-running series and can follow them far better than I can this one. Part of this is that Thomas’ plots have become <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">unbelievably</span>  so intricate that they hinge on tiny details. Worse &#8211; and it pains me to say this &#8211; the clues relevant here, especially those left by Mr. Marbleton, were too far fetched for this reader.</p>\n<p><strong>Caz: </strong> I’d have to agree with that on both counts.  The ‘treasure hunt’ was interesting and very clever, but maybe just a little bit <em>too</em> clever?  I like a complex plot, and that aspect of the books has worked for me so far, but it’s getting too convoluted. One of my biggest issues over the last couple of books is something I touched on in my review of <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/murder-on-cold-street-by-sherry-thomas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Murder on Cold Street</strong> </a>&#8211; and you’ve mentioned it, too &#8211; the Moriarty Plot. One of the problems I’m having with the series as a whole is that he’s just so… nebulous, that I can’t work out why Charlotte et al are so scared of him.  In fact, I’ve realised that my view of him &#8211; he’s an evil mastermind who is always Up To No Good &#8211; is based pretty much entirely on the fact that I know he’s the Big Bad in Conan Doyle’s stories.  At least in the BBC version, Andrew Scott’s Moriarty was one of those oddly compelling treading-the-thin-line-between-genius-and-madness types &#8211; but this Moriarty is so hazy that the stakes for our heroes just aren’t very clear.</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: And that lack of clear characterization which, I suspect, Thomas has taken from Conan Doyle&#8217;s books &#8211; he only appeared in two of the stories &#8211; makes the way in which everyone else responds to him hard to parse. These books are not adaptations, they’re original tales that borrow from source material <strong>somewhat</strong>. I feel as though we are stuck in some fictional world where, in order to appreciate Thomas’ undeniable genius, we have to both understand Conan Doyle’s characters while making sense of Thomas’. That combination just isn’t working for me.</p>\n<p><strong>Caz:</strong>  It’s been a long time since I read any of the original Holmes stories, but I think you’re right.  And while having a single-note baddie may have worked back when they were written, modern mysteries have moved on and generally tend to flesh them out a lot more.  It seems we’re both having similar issues.  So, what, if anything, did you like about this one?</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: Thomas is a gorgeous writer, her descriptions of people and places are grounded and believable.

                "text": "A most unexpected client shows up at Charlotte Holmes&#8217;s doorstep: Moriarty himself. Moriarty fears that tragedy has befallen his daughter and wants Charlotte to find out the truth. Charlotte and Mrs. Watson travel to a remote community of occult practitioners where Moriarty&#8217;s daughter was last seen, a place full of lies and liars. Meanwhile, Charlotte’s sister Livia tries to make sense of a mysterious message from her beau Mr. Marbleton. And Charlotte’s longtime friend and ally Lord Ingram at last turns his seductive prowess on Charlotte—or is it the other way around? But the more secrets Charlotte unravels about Miss Moriarty’s disappearance, the more she wonders why Moriarty has entrusted this delicate matter to her of all people. Is it merely to test Charlotte&#8217;s skills as an investigator, or has the man of shadows trapped her in a nest of vipers? The game is &#8211; once again &#8211; very much afoot in this sixth installment in Sherry Thomas’ Lady Sherlock series of clever historical mysteries.  As the synopsis indicates, she finally comes face-to-face with her nemesis &#8211; but rather than the expected violent confrontation, ‘Mr. Baxter’ instead wants to engage Holmes’ services to investigate the disappearance of his daughter from a Hermetic (possibly occultist) community in a remote corner of Cornwall.  Of course, Charlotte knows not to take anything at face value, but with no other options available, Charlotte, Lord Ingram and Mrs. Watson head for the Garden of Hermopolis to see what they can find out.  In the meantime, Charlotte’s sister, Livia, is following an intriguing trail of breadcrumbs left by Stephen Marbleton that leads to some very intriguing coded messages which could prove vital in the fight against Moriarty. Caz and Dabney are both massive Sherry Thomas fans and have followed the series since day one &#8211; although their opinions over the last couple of books have diverged.  They both read Miss Moriarty, I Presume? and are here to share their thoughts about the novel. Caz: Dabney, I know I’ve enjoyed the last couple of Lady Sherlock books a bit more than you have &#8211; but much as it pains me to say it, even I found this one to be a bit of a slog.  None of the books really work as standalones, and that’s especially true of Miss Moriarty, which feels like a culmination of all that has gone before.  There are lots of references to events and characters from previous books, but while I was pleased to see all the puzzle pieces being drawn together, I did at times struggle to recall all the whos, whats whens and whys &#8211; and it made for a pretty dense read. Dabney: I want to love this series, I do. And the first two were fabulous and the third quite good but since then, well, I’m losing interest. Each of the last three books has required recalling in detail the preceding books, to the point that without my Kindle’s search feature, I’d have been lost. The plotting is, as you say, dense and the story arcs of the series &#8211; Charlotte and Ash, Moriarty’s true aims, Livia and Mr. Marbleton &#8211; are leisurely. At this point, I’m hoping she’ll speed up these resolutions and move on. The adage all good things must come to an end resonates for a reason. Caz:  I agree that there’s been a loss of momentum over the past book or two.  I haven’t found it too much of a problem to be able to recall the plot details I needed to follow each book, but this time around?  Yeah, I was reading things and thinking “I know I should know why this is important…” but couldn’t always remember why, and that was frustrating.  Maybe that’s a failure on my part, but even though I follow a number of mystery series that require some knowledge of what went before, I struggled here.  There were things I liked a lot, but as a whole, I found Miss Moriarty, I Presume? to be tough going.  The first half is pretty slow &#8211; actually, the first two-thirds or so is slow &#8211; although fortunately, it did pick up later in the second half and reached a satisfying conclusion.  Although there is clearly more to come. Dabney: I too follow several long-running series and can follow them far better than I can this one. Part of this is that Thomas’ plots have become unbelievably  so intricate that they hinge on tiny details. Worse &#8211; and it pains me to say this &#8211; the clues relevant here, especially those left by Mr. Marbleton, were too far fetched for this reader. Caz:  I’d have to agree with that on both counts.  The ‘treasure hunt’ was interesting and very clever, but maybe just a little bit too clever?  I like a complex plot, and that aspect of the books has worked for me so far, but it’s getting too convoluted. One of my biggest issues over the last couple of books is something I touched on in my review of Murder on Cold Street &#8211; and you’ve mentioned it, too &#8211; the Moriarty Plot. One of the problems I’m having with the series as a whole is that he’s just so… nebulous, that I can’t work out why Charlotte et al are so scared of him.  In fact, I’ve realised that my view of him &#8211; he’s an evil mastermind who is always Up To No Good &#8211; is based pretty much entirely on the fact that I know he’s the Big Bad in Conan Doyle’s stories.  At least in the BBC version, Andrew Scott’s Moriarty was one of those oddly compelling treading-the-thin-line-between-genius-and-madness types &#8211; but this Moriarty is so hazy that the stakes for our heroes just aren’t very clear. Dabney: And that lack of clear characterization which, I suspect, Thomas has taken from Conan Doyle&#8217;s books &#8211; he only appeared in two of the stories &#8211; makes the way in which everyone else responds to him hard to parse. These books are not adaptations, they’re original tales that borrow from source material somewhat. I feel as though we are stuck in some fictional world where, in order to appreciate Thomas’ undeniable genius, we have to both understand Conan Doyle’s characters while making sense of Thomas’. That combination just isn’t working for me. Caz:  It’s been a long time since I read any of the original Holmes stories, but I think you’re right.  And while having a single-note baddie may have worked back when they were written, modern mysteries have moved on and generally tend to flesh them out a lot more.  It seems we’re both having similar issues.  So, what, if anything, did you like about this one? Dabney: Thomas is a gorgeous writer, her descriptions of people and places are grounded and believable. Her characters are interesting and her sly sense of humor is a gift. Ash and Charlotte are lovely together &#8211; I really would like to see far more of them as lovers &#8211; and Charlotte’s compassion for her sisters is boundless. I admire the braininess of these books even as it impedes my pleasure. Caz:  The writing is sublime, and the characterisations are amazing across the board.  I’d also like more of Ash and Charlotte as lovers, but I remind myself that this is historical mystery and not historical romance and tell myself to be happy with what we get!  Ash is delicious though &#8211; I do love those moments when the proper gentleman disappears and rawr!Ash makes an appearance ;)  The epistolary flirting at the beginning is sexy and fun (hah -and then the bag of contraceptives and the, er… *wink*) and even though things aren’t completely settled between them, there’s a real sense that they’re happy with the way things are.  And although I said the first part of the book is slow, I did like the scenes where they’re preparing for the visit by (as they think) Moriarty’s henchman; Sherry Thomas creates some amazing tension and unease there. Dabney: So what’s your grade? I think mine is a B simply because Thomas’ work is surpassingly better than most. Caz: Same, and for similar reasons. The final quarter is worth the price of admission, the writing is simply exceptional and I continue to love the characters.  But I am worried the series is becoming (has become?) a bit too complicated for its own good.

                "html": "<p>Last fall, trapped at home and dreaming of flying far away—anywhere!—I picked up <strong>Hostage</strong>. I thoroughly enjoyed Mackintosh’s previous books, especially <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/i-see-you-by-clare-mackintosh/\">her first two</a>, and was hopeful this too would be diverting.</p>\n<p>Two days later, having alienated everyone I encountered—I did not want to be disturbed about anything that wasn’t <em>definitively</em> <strong>urgent</strong>—I put down this book, desperate for the rest of the thriller loving world to read it. In short order, I had my husband, my best friend, and my neighbor flipping its pages as fast as they could too.</p>\n<p><strong>Hostage</strong> may make you think twice about flying but, reading while grounded, you’ll be transported.</p>\n<p>As the book begins, Mina, a flight attendant, is headed out on what will be the first nonstop flight from London to Sidney: Twenty hours in the air in a Boeing 777 filled with 353 press, passengers, pilots and other airline staff. Mina has pulled strings to be on this flight, not because it’s a big deal to her but rather as a way to temporarily escape her seemingly broken marriage. Mina loves Adam and their exceedingly precocious daughter Sophia, but she no longer trusts Adam—she’s convinced he was having an affair with their ex-au pair, a young Ukrainian woman who recently cryptically quit working for them.</p>\n<p>Over the first ten chapters, Mackintosh introduces Mina, her family, and her coworkers as well as a terrifyingly matter of fact group of passengers who are on the plane to… you got it… hijack it. They’re eco-terrorists who plan to crash the plane if the airline industry doesn’t agree to significantly cut its carbon footprint.

                "text": "Last fall, trapped at home and dreaming of flying far away—anywhere!—I picked up Hostage. I thoroughly enjoyed Mackintosh’s previous books, especially her first two, and was hopeful this too would be diverting. Two days later, having alienated everyone I encountered—I did not want to be disturbed about anything that wasn’t definitively urgent—I put down this book, desperate for the rest of the thriller loving world to read it. In short order, I had my husband, my best friend, and my neighbor flipping its pages as fast as they could too. Hostage may make you think twice about flying but, reading while grounded, you’ll be transported. As the book begins, Mina, a flight attendant, is headed out on what will be the first nonstop flight from London to Sidney: Twenty hours in the air in a Boeing 777 filled with 353 press, passengers, pilots and other airline staff. Mina has pulled strings to be on this flight, not because it’s a big deal to her but rather as a way to temporarily escape her seemingly broken marriage. Mina loves Adam and their exceedingly precocious daughter Sophia, but she no longer trusts Adam—she’s convinced he was having an affair with their ex-au pair, a young Ukrainian woman who recently cryptically quit working for them. Over the first ten chapters, Mackintosh introduces Mina, her family, and her coworkers as well as a terrifyingly matter of fact group of passengers who are on the plane to… you got it… hijack it. They’re eco-terrorists who plan to crash the plane if the airline industry doesn’t agree to significantly cut its carbon footprint. The reader is shown their thinking early on but has no idea who, on the plane, they are. Shortly after the plane takes off, Mina is shocked to discover Sophia’s EpiPen in Mina’s flight bag. This makes no sense—Mina knows it is always kept in Sophia’s school backpack because her daughter has severe nut allergy. Mina thinks she must have made a mistake but then, less than 30 minutes later, a passenger suddenly and suspiciously dies and, while Mina is going through his pockets for his ID, she finds a picture of Sophia, clearly taken earlier in the day. Mina is freaking out when things get much worse. The hijackers slip her a note demanding her help in commandeering the plane. If she doesn’t do their bidding, Sophia will die. Back in London, Adam and Sophia are also being threatened. Neither they nor Mina have any way to communicate, a situation used to great advantage by the terrorists.

Big city East Coast girl comes to a small town in the Pacific Northwest to work with a family with five brawny, gorgeous brothers (and one married sister) who run a failing outdoor adventure company. All five are single and will, one assumes, in five books, find true love. This book&#8217;s hero was burned by a city girl in the past and will never love again. The marketing savvy heroine hates small towns and trusts no one due to a tragic past. Throw in a severe case of insta-lust, a meet cute involving ducklings, and way too many jokes about the heroine&#8217;s inappropriate footwear&#8211;this is rural Oregon for heaven&#8217;s sake!&#8211;and you have <strong>Make Me Wilder</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>Now Dabney</em>, you say, <em>you say this like it&#8217;s a bad thing!</em></p>\n<p>OK, OK, it&#8217;s not a bad thing. I enjoyed this book. Bell is a terrific witty writer and her characters, despite being tropey types, are interesting and have just enough quirks that they&#8217;re kinda adorable. The sex is hot and the family dynamics&#8211;I especially like the Wilder women&#8211;are well-done and believable. And given that Jill Shalvis, Sarah Morgan, and Kristan Higgins have all moved to women&#8217;s fiction, Bell is a good replacement for those looking for sexy, fun, contemporary romance.</p>\n<p>Our high heeled wearing heroine, Lucy, is temporarily escaping Manhattan after a highly mortifying business meeting at which it became clear to all her colleagues that Lucy had inadvertently slept with her boss&#8217;s fiance. Lucy hightails it to Rush Creek, Oregon where her mom is currently shacked up with a new love. Rush Creek has struggled economically and Barb Wilder, the widowed matriarch of the Wilder clan, has hired Lucy to convince the Wilder brothers that Wilder Adventurers needs a more female&#8211;think bridesmaids parties and connect with your kids outings&#8211;makeover.</p>\n<p>This is not an easy task. The Wilder brothers are all, to a man, disdainful of selling out, compromising their old-school vision of outdoor experiences, and pretty sure Lucy, whom they all agree is smokin&#8217; hot, has nothing professional to offer them. No one feels this more strongly than Gabe, the oldest Wilder brother who is its de facto CEO.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Gabe, since he first spotted Lucy&#8211;she was trying to save some stranded ducklings and he, deeply competent in all things in nature, steps in to help&#8211;their chemistry is off the charts. Within an hour of their first encounter, they&#8217;ve met in the lobby of Lucy&#8217;s hotel and are about to head upstairs when Gabe figures out who Lucy is in town to work for. (His mother neglected to mention to her sons that she&#8217;d hired a marketing consultant.)

                "html": "<p>Sigh.</p>\n<p>My first (reading) impression of this book was that it was worse than the last Sally Thorne book, <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/99-percent-mine-by-sally-thorne/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>99% Mine</strong></a>, a book I gave a C grade to only because I so liked the best friend that I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to give it a D. Thus, after reading about 25% of <strong>Second First Impressions</strong>, I put it down and decided I&#8217;d come back to it when&#8211;maybe?&#8211;its annoyingly quirky characters and overly twee heroine didn&#8217;t irritate the hell out of me.</p>\n<p>A month or so later, I gave the book another try and&#8230; nope.</p>\n<p>This time, I managed to make it to the 75% mark and then, well, I just quit. The best thing I can say about this book is that it is not for me and I&#8217;m just happy that all those readers who love a painfully sweet, twee heroine with the real world sense of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWzezWq7FkA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Michael Scott</a> to fall in love with a man-child who&#8217;s supposed to be charmingly asinine but is really a dullard finally have a love story they can treasure.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t finish this book&#8211;I&#8217;m about to turn 60 and knowing I have only a quarter or so of life left to me made me feel that time could be better spent <del>doing anything else</del> watching Taylor Swift videos and deciding, definitively, which is her best. (It&#8217;s this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdneKLhsWOQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">one</a>.)</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I can tell you about it based on the first three quarters.

                "text": "Sigh. My first (reading) impression of this book was that it was worse than the last Sally Thorne book, 99% Mine, a book I gave a C grade to only because I so liked the best friend that I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to give it a D. Thus, after reading about 25% of Second First Impressions, I put it down and decided I&#8217;d come back to it when&#8211;maybe?&#8211;its annoyingly quirky characters and overly twee heroine didn&#8217;t irritate the hell out of me. A month or so later, I gave the book another try and&#8230; nope. This time, I managed to make it to the 75% mark and then, well, I just quit. The best thing I can say about this book is that it is not for me and I&#8217;m just happy that all those readers who love a painfully sweet, twee heroine with the real world sense of Michael Scott to fall in love with a man-child who&#8217;s supposed to be charmingly asinine but is really a dullard finally have a love story they can treasure. I didn&#8217;t finish this book&#8211;I&#8217;m about to turn 60 and knowing I have only a quarter or so of life left to me made me feel that time could be better spent doing anything else watching Taylor Swift videos and deciding, definitively, which is her best. (It&#8217;s this one.) Here&#8217;s what I can tell you about it based on the first three quarters. Ruthie, age 25,  lives in a town in someplace that one would be hard pressed to believe in know where it is.  She is the acting office manager of the Providence Retirement Villa whose inhabitants are each so specifically nutty you&#8217;d think the place only admitted extras from a poorly received Wes Anderson film.

Nicholas pulled out and ran as though chased by the hounds of hell. Since then, he&#8217;s pretended she doesn&#8217;t exist.

Nicholas has been in sexual hell since his marriage. All he can think about is pounding into his genteel wife but is convinced that&#8217;s a bad and inappropriate idea given her delicate sensibilities. He believes she wants nothing to do with him. He&#8217;s coped by masturbating endlessly while fantasizing his virtuous wife but it&#8217;s not enough. He&#8217;d come to the Nunnery thinking he’d find relief bedding a whore, but found, much to his despair, he only wants his Helena.</p>\n<p>However, when a gorgeous woman runs into him&#8211;he&#8217;s watching the sexual gymnastics behind a drapery&#8211;he&#8217;s instantly and overwhelmingly aroused. The minute the trio leaves, Nicholas tosses Helena on the nearest table and the two have the hottest sex of his (and her) life. Helena, afraid he’d be appalled at her bawdy behavior, uses a French accent as she moans.  Once finished, Nicholas drops a fifty-pound note on the table and walks away.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, Nicholas feels like a horrible human being, having fucked a whore not his wife while fantasizing that she was. Helena, however, wants a great deal more of that kind of passion and is determined to win her husband&#8217;s affections.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not easy.</p>\n<p>No matter what she does, Nicholas is a jerk. The nicer she is to him, the nastier he is to her. This pisses her off and she isn&#8217;t shy telling him he&#8217;s behaving even more abysmally than usual. Normally this dynamic would irritate me, but here it works. Nicholas has good reasons for believing he&#8217;s not good enough for his wife. The horrors of his childhood and youth have left him deeply shameful and he simply doesn&#8217;t know how to overcome his self-loathing.</p>\n<p>I liked both Nicholas and Helena. Over time, the two learn to trust and rely on each other in ways that feel real. They do begin to make love and the sex scenes are delightfully graphic and add to their growing intimacy. The romance in this book is a good one and if you like dirty talk and adventurous marital sex in your love stories, I suspect you&#8217;ll enjoy this one.</p>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t as enthralled with the suspense plot that takes up a great deal of the tale.

                "html": "<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When life throws her one setback too many, midwife and young widow Tess Hartsong takes off for Runaway Mountain. In this small town high in the Tennessee mountains, surrounded by nature, she hopes to outrun her heartbreak and find the solace she needs to heal. </span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But instead of peace and quiet, she encounters an enigmatic artist with a craving for solitude, a fairy-tale sprite with too many secrets, a helpless infant, a passel of curious teens, and a town suspicious of outsiders, especially one as headstrong as Tess. Just as headstrong, is Ian North, a difficult, gifted man with a tortured soul—a man who makes Tess question everything. </span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In running away to this new life, Tess wonders— Has she lost herself . . . or has she found her future?</span></em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Kristen:</strong> So, Dabney. There is A LOT to talk about in this book &#8211; ideas about motherhood, small town relationships, grief, trauma, insiders/outsiders&#8230; where do you want to start? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Dabney:</strong> This book is nuts but not necessarily in a bad way. Or is it just me?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Kristen:</strong> I’m not sure I’d say “bad way”, but I didn’t love it. It felt like a fifteen pound story in a five pound bag. There was just </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">so much</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and a lot of it didn’t resonate with me at all, which is why I’m glad to be talking to you about it since we have different life experiences when it comes to motherhood. I, for example, am not one, and so a lot of Tess’ motivations felt foreign to me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Dabney:</strong> The motherhood thing was interesting and, oddly, parts of it made me very uncomfortable. But let’s start with Tess. She’s an interesting woman but I would not want to be her friend. You?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Kristen:</strong> I was legitimately afraid of her a few times! She’s intense, that’s for sure, and I don’t think she’d like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">me</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> very much. She was clearly a product of a lot of trauma (her husband’s death, another tragedy early in the story) and that colors how she interacts with herself and others, but it didn’t make for a character I was eager to spend more time with. I wasn’t quite sure was Ms. Phillips was trying to do with the talk about her body &#8211; I never got a real grip on what Tess actually </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">looked</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> like. I’ve never lived in a town as small as Runaway Mountain (which is a very on-the-nose-name here), but we certainly don’t usually see the cruelty of small towns in romance like this. What did you think about her interactions with the town? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Dabney:</strong> Well, all those mean people weren’t really, ultimately, mean. You just had to get to know them.

                "text": "When life throws her one setback too many, midwife and young widow Tess Hartsong takes off for Runaway Mountain. In this small town high in the Tennessee mountains, surrounded by nature, she hopes to outrun her heartbreak and find the solace she needs to heal.  But instead of peace and quiet, she encounters an enigmatic artist with a craving for solitude, a fairy-tale sprite with too many secrets, a helpless infant, a passel of curious teens, and a town suspicious of outsiders, especially one as headstrong as Tess. Just as headstrong, is Ian North, a difficult, gifted man with a tortured soul—a man who makes Tess question everything.  In running away to this new life, Tess wonders— Has she lost herself . . . or has she found her future? Kristen: So, Dabney. There is A LOT to talk about in this book &#8211; ideas about motherhood, small town relationships, grief, trauma, insiders/outsiders&#8230; where do you want to start?  Dabney: This book is nuts but not necessarily in a bad way. Or is it just me? Kristen: I’m not sure I’d say “bad way”, but I didn’t love it. It felt like a fifteen pound story in a five pound bag. There was just so much and a lot of it didn’t resonate with me at all, which is why I’m glad to be talking to you about it since we have different life experiences when it comes to motherhood. I, for example, am not one, and so a lot of Tess’ motivations felt foreign to me.  Dabney: The motherhood thing was interesting and, oddly, parts of it made me very uncomfortable. But let’s start with Tess. She’s an interesting woman but I would not want to be her friend. You? Kristen: I was legitimately afraid of her a few times! She’s intense, that’s for sure, and I don’t think she’d like me very much. She was clearly a product of a lot of trauma (her husband’s death, another tragedy early in the story) and that colors how she interacts with herself and others, but it didn’t make for a character I was eager to spend more time with. I wasn’t quite sure was Ms. Phillips was trying to do with the talk about her body &#8211; I never got a real grip on what Tess actually looked like. I’ve never lived in a town as small as Runaway Mountain (which is a very on-the-nose-name here), but we certainly don’t usually see the cruelty of small towns in romance like this. What did you think about her interactions with the town?  Dabney: Well, all those mean people weren’t really, ultimately, mean. You just had to get to know them. It certainly is a town where not a single person didn’t seem exceedingly unique&#8211;everyone was a CHARACTER. Kristen: Huh. I didn’t see it that way. I saw some of their ‘character’ as being cruel to be cruel, but I can see how that’s not necessarily true.  Dabney: And, here’s my real problem with this book: I didn’t like hardly ANYONE in it. Not Tess, not Ian, not Bianca, not Tess’s wacky coworkers, no one. Except Wren. Wren I liked because, well, babies. Kristen: Oh, I kinda liked the babysitter. But beyond that? With you. Plus, I have no idea why Ian and Tess got together in the end.  Dabney: I didn’t understand them at all. I guess Ian is the hottest older guy since Idris Elba so maybe that’s why Tess fell so hard for him. But he was so often an ass and did not appear to understand the concept of compromise. And as for why Ian fell for Tess, I thought at first it was because she was so competent. But then she became so cranky that I didn’t get her appeal.

This, the second book in the series, is set in the same world, but has little noticeable carry-over from the first book. I think readers could easily start with <strong>Dragon Unleashed</strong> without feeling overly confused. What do you think?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Dabney: Completely agree. If you&#8217;d read <strong>Phoenix Unbound</strong>, you&#8217;d have a deeper understanding of some of the references but, as a story, <strong>Dragon Unleashed</strong> works just fine as a stand alone novel.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Shannon: And what an epic novel I found it to be! Draven&#8217;s world building is completely immersive and her characters practically leapt off the page for me. There&#8217;s so much depth in what she&#8217;s created here, and in some ways, I feel like we&#8217;ve barely scratched the surface of this world and these people, and yet, at the same time, Helani and Malachus feel like old and familiar friends. It&#8217;s an unusual dichotomy, but one I often look for when reading fantasy romance. What were your overall impressions of <strong>Dragon Unleashed</strong>?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Dabney: I thoroughly enjoyed reading it&#8230; but not quite as much as I did Phoenix Unbound. But given that I <em>adored</em> <strong>Phoenix Unbound</strong>, that&#8217;s not much of a criticism.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>This is a quieter story and the leads felt much much older and, in ways I really liked, wiser. Helani and Malachus are both deliberative about the choices they make and I enjoyed watching them slowly figure out a way towards not only their own HEA but building a better world for all. Helani&#8217;s powers aren&#8217;t superpower showy and I liked that. Both of them have almost a meditative quality to the way they interact with the world. <strong>Dragon Unleashed</strong> unfurls slowly but I very much enjoyed the journey.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Shannon: Those are great points. I suppose some readers might find the pacing a bit too slow for them, but I really enjoyed watching the story unfold in a way that didn&#8217;t feel like too much action crammed into one book.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Shannon: Since you brought up Helani and her magical abilities, I&#8217;d like to touch on her character a bit more. She&#8217;s kind and compassionate, but she&#8217;s also strong and resourceful. At first, I worried she&#8217;d feel too good to be true, but the author made sure to give her some struggles that made her feel relatable. I loved her relationship with her mother as well as her willingness to openly care for those around her. What did you think of Helani as a person?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Dabney: She is <i>very</i> self-sacrificing BUT she is true to herself and, by the story&#8217;s end, I believed in her choices. I loved her relationship with her mother&#8211;it&#8217;s interesting to have the parent/child roles so reversed. <strong>Dragon Unleashed</strong>, despite its title, is really Helani&#8217;s story which is one of self-discovery and fulfillment. If you like novels where strong women figure out how to be their true selves and save the world, you&#8217;ll love this effort by Draven.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Shannon: Absolutely! Helani&#8217;s inner journey is the backbone of this tale.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Shannon: Moving on to Malachus now, dragons aren&#8217;t always my favorite mythological creatures to read about, but I ended up enjoying getting to know Malachus and the way dragon mythology is handled in this world. He could be a little self-righteous at times, but I loved his ability to learn from his mistakes rather than simply stagnating. He had a kind spirit that really spoke to me in certain parts of the book. He won&#8217;t be everyone&#8217;s ideal hero, but I found him quite intriguing. What about you?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Dabney: And see I dig dragons! I loved the dragon mythology and Malachus&#8217; history. His self-righteousness seemed so valid to me&#8211;he has no choice but to be single minded about his goals. It was lovely to see that for all his strength, pain, and focus on his outcomes, he isn&#8217;t an annoying alpha. His embrace of Helani and his commitment to supporting her was lovely.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Shannon: The one  facet of Malachus&#8217; story that didn&#8217;t quite work for me had to do with the mother bond. It took me quite a while to really understand the connection between the actual bond and the artefact that housed it. For all Draven&#8217;s attention to detail in other aspects of the novel, this particular part lacked clarity. Was there anything you found difficult to relate to or understand?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Dabney: I found the implementation of Helani&#8217;s magic a bit hard to follow. I think both the mother bond magic and her earth magic are harder to comprehend how they <em>actually</em> work than I&#8217;d have liked. One thing I loved about <strong>Phoenix Unbound</strong> was how visceral the magic wielded by Gilene was. Here, the magic is harder to parse.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Shannon: As far as a final grade, I&#8217;d give this an A-. It was close to perfect, but a bit more description of the magic system would have been helpful. What is your final grade?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Dabney: This is closer to a B for me.

I didn’t like the completely bizarre stranger insta-lust that set our principal characters in each other&#8217;s path (and shouldn’t they have already been in each others circles?), and I kept waiting&#8230; and waiting&#8230; and waiting for someone to ACTUALLY OR FIGURATIVELY chase Cassandra. But no one ever did! Certainly not Tom Severin, who essentially decided he wanted Cassandra and then tried to talk himself out of it almost immediately. Because he liked her too much? The entire story felt like one big elaborate farce &#8211; they liked each other and wanted to be together so why not give it a try? &#8211; and I never got to know either of the principal characters enough to know if I liked them as individuals or a couple. This is a full length book that could have been two chapters.</p>\n<p>What did you two think?</p>\n<p><strong>Evelyn:</strong> I liked it more than you. I enjoyed getting to know how Tom Severin worked &#8211; he’s been an interesting supporting character for awhile and I was happy to get more of him. I agree that you had to buy into his instant feelings for Cassandra for the book to work, and there were scenes that I liked &#8211; such as the discussions of their &#8216;marriage contract&#8217;, the scenes with Tom and his friends, and the boiler scene. I’d say I enjoyed the first two-thirds of the book but then it went a little off kilter. I kept imagining the Marquis coming back to undermine Severin &#8211; and where did Lady Berwick go? The ending was a little too contrived for me, too. It wasn’t close to my favorite Kleypas but I enjoyed most of it.</p>\n<p>Dabney, did this one work for you?</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney:</strong> *struggles to recall anything &#8211; anything! &#8211; about <strong>Chasing Cassandra*</strong></p>\n<p>Not really. It wasn’t bad &#8211; no glaring plot holes or character leaps &#8211; nor was it interesting. It’s a somewhat similar story to Kleypas’ <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/tempt-me-at-twilight-by-lisa-kleypas/\"><strong>Tempt Me at Twilight</strong></a> (a book I like much more than this) but in this retelling, the instalust and the lack of any real barrier to true love made for a very slow read.</p>\n<p><strong>Evelyn:</strong> Yes, the barrier was &#8216;I can’t love you because I don’t want the emotion of love in my life, if it even exists&#8217; &#8211; which is a tough sell for me. But I bought it &#8211; it was just what I expected Severin to be like. He’s definitely a hero who has shut down his vulnerable, feeling side. What did you guys think of Severin as a hero?</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney:</strong> Despite having read the earlier books in this series, Severin hadn’t really registered for me. Thus I had no expectations of who he would be as a hero. I must say, I’m sort of over these Kleypas heroes that are THE defining men of their time. Professionally, Severin seemed like a capitalist superhero and while I love learning about how new technologies shaped the Victorian era, I rolled my eyes at all that Severin did. And I truly do not like the &#8216;I can’t love because it’s too dangerous&#8217; trope in romance. I am grateful that it wasn’t combined with &#8216;She’s too good for me&#8217;, another trope I rarely enjoy!</p>\n<p><strong>Em:</strong> I’m not going to heap onto the anti-Severin sentiments; I’ll simply say I agree, I didn’t know him well enough to like or hate him, and I didn’t understand his character motivations. At all. That said, Cassandra didn’t really work for me either. She’s seemingly bright and lovely, so why do only creeps like her? And if her family is so AMAZING AND AWESOME AND SURROUNDED BY AMAZING AND AWESOME people, where are the actual contenders for her heart? I thought she was naive in the extreme, and aside from her beauty and perfect manners &#8211; with homeless boys (ahem) and hard headed males &#8211; she’s kind of blah. Frankly, several weeks out from reading this story I’m also struggling to remember her in any significant way. Did you like her?</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney:</strong> Well, here’s one thing I thought was odd. Cassandra is supposed to be so gorgeous that men turn to gibbering idiots when she walks by and yet Kleypas never describes her. I don’t know what she looks like nor do I know how Severin sees her. I felt as though the book wanted it both ways: Cassandra’s beauty is the draw for Severin, at least initially, but that beauty isn’t dwelt on at all. It just was weird. As for liking her, sure, what’s not to like? But that’s not my kind of heroine. I like my leads to have depth and I just didn’t feel that here.</p>\n<p><strong>Em:</strong> Ladies, what I really want to talk about is the ridiculous deus ex machina after Cassandra finds herself in a spot of trouble. She’s nearly ruined&#8230; and then. Well, I won’t give it away but COME ON. Her ruination was clunky, the true villain has a blink and you’ll miss it appearance, and then it’s rainbows and unicorns in the very next chapter. What is the point??!!</p>\n<p><strong>Evelyn:</strong> I think that’s the place in the book where it started losing steam for me. I honestly thought the villains must be coming back at some point but…</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney:</strong> Yep. The plot in this book takes such a backseat to the characters. And that would have worked for me if the characters had more oomph. But I just found myself flipping through the pages.</p>\n<p><strong>Evelyn:</strong> I did like Severin. And his comments on the classics he read were hilarious. He and Cassandra are not going to be remembered as a great romantic couple but I think fans of the <em><strong>Ravenels</strong></em> will root for them. For me, the quality of the book varied &#8211; like I said, the first parts pulled me in, but the last parts left me scratching my head a little. Did you two enjoy any parts of the story?</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney:</strong> I loved the book plot; for me it was the strongest part of the story. And I enjoyed learning about trains, and how society’s needs for housing and transportation were changing so rapidly at that time.</p>\n<p><strong>Em:</strong> Agreed; the book discussions are a highlight. I also enjoyed the brief cameos of past Ravenel couples. But this couple? Well, I wish Cassandra’s possible ruination had been a bigger part of the story and that the villains were better developed. I’m reading another historical romance now, and the ruin of the heroine is central to her entire storyline from start to finish. It’s so much better finessed, and served as a means to develop and define the heroine. This story starts with two strangers falling in lust, and ends with them declaring it love. I couldn’t make the jump and I think readers are going to struggle with it too.</p>\n<p><strong>Evelyn:</strong> So it sounds like fans of the Ravenel series will enjoy seeing cameos of past characters but this story won’t wow them. Is that a decent summary?</p>\n<p><strong>Em:</strong> Yep. <strong>I&#8217;m giving it a C-</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney:</strong> If you’re looking for a romance with a zinger of a plot and complex characters, this probably isn’t the novel for you. But, if you’re a Kleypas fan and love the Ravenels and friends, you’ll enjoy this book. <strong>It gets a C from me</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Evelyn:</strong> I think that’s a fair summary.

Have you read anything else she’s written?</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: I have not. But, whoa, after this book, I&#8217;d like to. I found this book to be riveting and I know you did too. What struck you the most?</p>\n<p><strong>Shannon</strong>: One of the most important themes of the novel is sisterhood. The relationship between Mickey and Kacey is incredibly nuanced, and in many ways, it’s what propels the story forward. I was invested in both women almost from the beginning of the story, due in large part to the remarkable way the author allowed readers to know them both so well. How did Moore’s depiction of this relationship work for you?</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: It&#8217;s interesting to see the world through the eyes of just one person in the story. In this case, since we only get Mickey&#8217;s view&#8211;it&#8217;s a first person narration&#8211;our view of the sisters is her view. Sometimes first person narratives are too limited for me but in this case the way Moore tells the story switching between <em>Then</em> and <em>Now</em> lets us see how profoundly Kacey and Mickey are connected. Their relationship is heartbreaking, believable, and complicated in the way that sibling relationships inherently are.</p>\n<p><strong>Shannon</strong>: You make a good point here, and so, I’d like to talk a bit more about Mickey. She grew up in the shadow of addiction. It obviously had a profound effect on her, and I loved the way the author used the flashbacks to younger Mickey to illustrate the changes she went through as she aged. I found her an easy character to have empathy for, even if I didn’t always agree with her choices. How did Mickey work for you?</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: I like unreliable narrators and Mickey is that. Every adult in her childhood let her down in part to addiction but also because&#8211;and I&#8217;m thinking of her grandmother Gee here&#8211;they simply aren&#8217;t capable of compassionate, good caretaking. Mickey&#8217;s ability to understand people is, as a result of her borderline abusive childhood, flawed. She makes mistake after mistake about the people in her life&#8211;and perhaps nowhere is that more true than with Kacey. She alienates people unnecessarily and compromises herself at work. She takes shortcuts that are hard to accept although Moore does a stellar job of showing the reader why. Mickey isn&#8217;t a character I admire but, even with all her flaws, Moore made me understand and respect her.</p>\n<p><strong>Shannon</strong>: Gee was a hard character for me to feel good about. She treated Mickey and Kacey horribly and didn’t seem to be aware of the harm she’d done. In her mind, meeting their physical needs counted as caring for them. I was relieved to see Mickey taking a different tack with her own child, even if her parenting decisions weren’t always the wisest. Moore excels at helping us see all sides of complex issues, and that’s one of the things I liked best about this book. What stands out for you?</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>:<strong> Long Bright River</strong> makes the world we see in the headlines&#8211;the thousand people who overdose every week, the families destroyed by addiction&#8211;palpable. So, in a way, what stands out for me is the world-building. But the book is more than a grim urban <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2RwqZW5\"><strong>Hillbilly Elegy</strong></a>. Moore&#8217;s characters are layered&#8211;both tragic and heroic&#8211;and, despite their contradictions, worth rooting for.</p>\n<p><strong>Shannon</strong>: I completely agree with you. By creating characters we can empathize with, Moore helps us realize that real people are affected by addiction every day.</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: Yes. And despite it being a grim world, there&#8217;s humor in Moore&#8217;s writing. It is a nerve-wracking read but it didn&#8217;t make me sad by the story&#8217;s end.</p>\n<p><strong>Shannon</strong>: Getting back to the novel’s narrative structure for a moment, what did you think of the flashbacks? There’s a part of me that would have liked to see some of those scenes through Kacey’s eyes. I wondered what she was thinking and feeling, especially as she spiraled deeper into addiction. I wasn’t necessarily displeased by the author’s choice to filter everything through Mickey, but I did have questions about Kacey’s perspective.</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: I very much liked the structure of the story. I&#8217;ve read this book twice and am now convinced that the greatness of this book lies in more than its depiction of a city hollowed out by drugs. Mickey&#8217;s voice and the way she tells the story, what she gets right and what she gets wrong, is brilliant. If we&#8217;d heard Kacey&#8217;s or anyone else&#8217;s voice, I think it would have been a lesser book.</p>\n<p><strong>Shannon</strong>: I can definitely see that. So, I hate saying this since it’s only January, but I can easily see this book being one of my favorite reads of 2020. I gave it 5 stars on GoodReads and I<strong>’m giving it an A</strong> here at AAR. It’s hard-hitting in the very best way, and I loved every minute I spent with these characters.

I’ve read it again and again—it’s my favorite of Calhoun’s books and has been since it was first published in 2013.

Rachel left Elysian Fields because, as she says,</p>\n<blockquote><p>They needed me to be someone I am not. They expected me to surrender all choice and control in my life to God, and if God’s direction wasn’t clear, my pastor or my father would explain it to me.</p></blockquote>\n<p>One choice Rachel&#8217;s never made is to touch or be touched by a man. In Elysian Fields, all sexual contact is saved for marriage and Rachel, who stayed stubbornly unwed, is a virgin in every sense of the word. Rachel’s ready to change that and, one night, while working at a&nbsp;charity bachelor auction,&nbsp;Rachel decides she&#8217;s ready to get rid of her virginity (and a large swath of her savings) by bidding Ben Harris, a sexy SWAT officer up for auction. Ben looks to Rachel like the perfect man for the job.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Perfect, because she’d just bet two thousand dollars that he had no interest in a relationship, no sense that sex was something special reserved for the marriage bed, no inclination to call again.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ben doesn&#8217;t give a fuck. Not about anything but his job and his brother. He sure as shit doesn&#8217;t give a damn about the women he screws. But when he wakes up the morning after bedding Rachel, he&#8217;s first shocked and then furious to see blood on his cock. He tracks Rachel down and asks her what the hell she thought she was doing. She tells him her virginity was hers to lose and, anyway, she didn&#8217;t think he would <em>know</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>care</em>. Ben, angry and intrigued, tells her he wants&nbsp;<em>another shot,&nbsp;</em>that he&#8217;s got what she&nbsp;<em>needs.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<blockquote><p>“You don’t know what I need,” she said as she glanced toward the barn&#8230;.</p>\n<p>“I remember,” he said without lowering his voice, “how you were shaking under me at the end. Look me in the eye and tell me you don’t need more.”</p>\n<p>She went still again, stiller than he thought possible&#8230;.</p>\n<p>“I want an explanation. You want to do it again. Longer. Slower. Hotter. This time we’ll both get what we want.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ben, who has slept with so many women he can&#8217;t remember their faces let alone their names, finds making love with Rachel disorienting. For him, sex is a means to keep emotion at bay. Fucking Rachel is terrifyingly different.</p>\n<p>Rachel uses sex the way she uses everything: as an implement for self-discovery. As Ben watches Rachel push herself to experience all she was denied at Elysian Fields, Ben starts to see himself differently. Rachel lives life authentically and Ben, whose self-imposed limits are destroying him, finds himself longing for what Rachel demands for herself.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s profoundly satisfying to watch Rachel evolve. Every experience Rachel has, whether it&#8217;s watching the way the Texas A&amp;M boys working at the farm for the summer play poker or taking in the expressions of amateur poets at open-mike night at her favorite bookstore in Galveston, Rachel uses it to build on what she&#8217;s previously seen and felt.

The books build on one another beautifully, each deepening the complex narrative and illuminating the dispositions and motivations of the characters. The principals here, varied and satisfyingly authentic, are among the believable I&#8217;ve encountered in fantasy. One of the many joys of <strong>The Queen of Nothing</strong> is seeing the conclusion of the stories of Madoc (Jude&#8217;s adoptive father who wants the throne for his own), Taryn, Vivi, the Ghost, the Bomb, and the Roach (fellow spies from The Court of Shadows where Jude once served) and a legion of others.

In <a href=\"https://amzn.to/34fWwzt\"><strong>The Cruel Prince</strong></a>, Cardan and Jude begin as enemies, he a hateful brutal prince whom Jude hates more than anyone else in the Court. Over the next thousand pages, the two form a snarled partnership that, by the series&#8217; end, empowers not only themselves but all of Faerieland. Theirs is love-hate story for the ages and one I suspect I&#8217;ll read and recommend again and again.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center\">Buy it at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/34fWwzt\">Amazon</a>/<a href=\"https://books.apple.com/us/book/the-queen-of-nothing/id1456158022?mt=11&amp;app=itunes&amp;at=1010lmPQ\">Apple Books</a>/<a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8039827/type/dlg/fragment/%2F/https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-queen-of-nothing-holly-black/1130884109?ean=9780316310406\">Barnes and Noble</a>/<a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=b95pXvP*dp4&amp;mid=37217&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Febook%2Fthe-queen-of-nothing\">Kobo</a></h3>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center\">or <a href=\"https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780316310420?aff=allaboutromance\">Shop your local indie bookstore</a></h3>\n",

The books build on one another beautifully, each deepening the complex narrative and illuminating the dispositions and motivations of the characters. The principals here, varied and satisfyingly authentic, are among the believable I&#8217;ve encountered in fantasy. One of the many joys of The Queen of Nothing is seeing the conclusion of the stories of Madoc (Jude&#8217;s adoptive father who wants the throne for his own), Taryn, Vivi, the Ghost, the Bomb, and the Roach (fellow spies from The Court of Shadows where Jude once served) and a legion of others. (I don&#8217;t recommend this book as a standalone.) At its marrow, though, the series is Cardan&#8217;s and Jude&#8217;s story and I&#8217;m hard pressed to think of a pair I&#8217;ve liked more. In The Cruel Prince, Cardan and Jude begin as enemies, he a hateful brutal prince whom Jude hates more than anyone else in the Court. Over the next thousand pages, the two form a snarled partnership that, by the series&#8217; end, empowers not only themselves but all of Faerieland. Theirs is love-hate story for the ages and one I suspect I&#8217;ll read and recommend again and again. Buy it at Amazon/Apple Books/Barnes and Noble/Kobo or Shop your local indie bookstore"

I advise you to quit reading this review and, instead, find a way to get your hands on both books.</p>\n<p>Still here? OK. That&#8217;s on you.</p>\n<p>Prior to reading these cracktastic books, I&#8217;d read one other Black book&#8211;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/33SiK9S\"><strong>The Darkest Part of the Forest</strong></a>&#8211;and had liked it but hadn&#8217;t been inspired to pick up another. (So many books, way too little time.) But then Bec McMaster began raving about <strong>The Cruel Prince</strong> on Facebook so, when it was recently an AAR Steal and Deal, I bought it. I began reading it on a plane and, let me tell you, the nation has never flashed by so quickly.</p>\n<p>Why? Well, to begin with: Jude. Jude is Black&#8217;s protagonist and, for all but the prologue of each book, their narrator. She is splendid. She&#8217;s everything I want in a character&#8211;complex, thoughtful, flawed, smart, and compelling. As the first book begins, Jude is verging on adulthood in the world of Faerie where, unlike anyone else, she and her twin sister Taryn are human AND members of the High Court&#8211;their adoptive father Madoc is the the General to the High King and has raised them as though they were his daughters in truth. Jude and Taryn have lived in Faerie for just over ten years and are profoundly aware that being a human in Faerie is no easy thing. The fey see humans as less than and, for Jude and her sister, that&#8217;s meant a decade of danger and daily humiliations.</p>\n<p>Jude&#8211;an utter bad ass&#8211;dreams of becoming a knight so she will have her own&#8211;and not Madoc&#8217;s&#8211;power and will thus be accepted as a permanent member of the Court. Her sister Taryn seeks another path to inclusion: marriage to a fairy of the High Court. The paths the women pursue will, over the course of the series, put them at risk and at odds. Though they&#8217;ve been lived the same lives in many ways, they don&#8217;t see the fey the same nor do the wish to wield power in the same way. Taryn is curiously subtle, more interested in kisses than in politics. Jude is ambitious&#8211;in no small part due to watching Madoc scheme. Thus when the current High King announces his retirement and his heirs&#8211;only a child of old Mab&#8217;s blood may rule&#8211;strive for the throne, Jude sees an opportunity for herself to ally well. And therein begins a story of violence, politics, love, fear, and magic.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s all I&#8217;ll say about the plot. I want you to have the joy of reading just as I did. #nospoilers</p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t a romance &#8211; I am still rooting for an HEA by the end of the series &#8211; although there is Cardan, the youngest of all the High King&#8217;s sons, inhumanly beautiful and routinely, horribly cruel. His relationship with Jude is perplexing and deeply dangerous to Jude&#8230; and perhaps to himself. Cardan and Jude are determined to protect what they want for themselves and for the kingdom and the ways they do so are keenly informed by complicated, compromised ethics.</p>\n<p>The Faerie of <em>The Folk of Air</em>, as the fairies of the High Court are called, is traditional and not. It&#8217;s a world where Vivienne, Jude&#8217;s older half-fairy sister, is in love with a mortal girl, fairies have alliances with humans and fairies of either sex, and weeds can be made into flying steeds. There are no cell-phones or TVs or fish sticks or bras. The magic the fairies have gives them the ability to do almost anything and yet they cannot lie and simple wards can rob them of their power. Jude, human by nature and fairy by nurture, uses her knowledge of both and maneuvers her way to&#8230; well, that would be telling.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve conveyed well enough the skill with which Black tells her tale. Readers looking for supple storytelling set in a singular world will be thrilled with <em>The Folk of Air</em>.  The third book in the series, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2BBovgc\"><strong>The Queen of Nothing</strong></a>, comes out on November 19th and I will be reading it immediately. You should too.</p>\n<h3>Buy it at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/341Izoh\">Amazon</a>/<a href=\"https://books.apple.com/us/book/the-cruel-prince/id1225110611?mt=11&amp;app=itunes&amp;at=1010lmPQ\">Apple Books</a>/<a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8039827/type/dlg/https://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/folk%20of%20the%20air%20series/_/N-8qa\">Barnes and Noble</a>/<a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=b95pXvP*dp4&amp;mid=37217&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Faudiobook%2Fthe-cruel-prince-2\">Kobo</a></h3>\n",

As the first book begins, Jude is verging on adulthood in the world of Faerie where, unlike anyone else, she and her twin sister Taryn are human AND members of the High Court&#8211;their adoptive father Madoc is the the General to the High King and has raised them as though they were his daughters in truth. Jude and Taryn have lived in Faerie for just over ten years and are profoundly aware that being a human in Faerie is no easy thing. The fey see humans as less than and, for Jude and her sister, that&#8217;s meant a decade of danger and daily humiliations. Jude&#8211;an utter bad ass&#8211;dreams of becoming a knight so she will have her own&#8211;and not Madoc&#8217;s&#8211;power and will thus be accepted as a permanent member of the Court. Her sister Taryn seeks another path to inclusion: marriage to a fairy of the High Court. The paths the women pursue will, over the course of the series, put them at risk and at odds. Though they&#8217;ve been lived the same lives in many ways, they don&#8217;t see the fey the same nor do the wish to wield power in the same way. Taryn is curiously subtle, more interested in kisses than in politics. Jude is ambitious&#8211;in no small part due to watching Madoc scheme. Thus when the current High King announces his retirement and his heirs&#8211;only a child of old Mab&#8217;s blood may rule&#8211;strive for the throne, Jude sees an opportunity for herself to ally well. And therein begins a story of violence, politics, love, fear, and magic. That&#8217;s all I&#8217;ll say about the plot. I want you to have the joy of reading just as I did. #nospoilers This isn&#8217;t a romance &#8211; I am still rooting for an HEA by the end of the series &#8211; although there is Cardan, the youngest of all the High King&#8217;s sons, inhumanly beautiful and routinely, horribly cruel. His relationship with Jude is perplexing and deeply dangerous to Jude&#8230; and perhaps to himself. Cardan and Jude are determined to protect what they want for themselves and for the kingdom and the ways they do so are keenly informed by complicated, compromised ethics. The Faerie of The Folk of Air, as the fairies of the High Court are called, is traditional and not. It&#8217;s a world where Vivienne, Jude&#8217;s older half-fairy sister, is in love with a mortal girl, fairies have alliances with humans and fairies of either sex, and weeds can be made into flying steeds. There are no cell-phones or TVs or fish sticks or bras. The magic the fairies have gives them the ability to do almost anything and yet they cannot lie and simple wards can rob them of their power. Jude, human by nature and fairy by nurture, uses her knowledge of both and maneuvers her way to&#8230; well, that would be telling. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve conveyed well enough the skill with which Black tells her tale. Readers looking for supple storytelling set in a singular world will be thrilled with The Folk of Air.  The third book in the series, The Queen of Nothing, comes out on November 19th and I will be reading it immediately. You should too. Buy it at Amazon/Apple Books/Barnes and Noble/Kobo"

In a good way.</p>\n<p><strong>Shannon</strong>: It broke mine too. Genevieve and Emma are damaged in very different ways, and the author did such a great job making me cheer them on, even when I didn’t like things they were doing.</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: Yep. Higgins is wonderful at creating complex women whose flaws don&#8217;t make you cringe.</p>\n<p><strong>Shannon</strong>: Genevieve was hard for me to warm up to initially. She treated Emma horribly, and I couldn’t understand what would cause her to behave that way. Fortunately, learning a bit about her back story helped turn her into a relatable character. Did either of you have a similar experience with her?</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: I couldn&#8217;t stand Genevieve for much of the book. BUT. I really enjoyed her as a character. This is one of Higgins&#8217; great skills&#8211;she can write characters whom you don&#8217;t like, aren&#8217;t rooting for, and still can&#8217;t wait to see what they do next.</p>\n<p><strong>Kristen</strong>: Oh, I never found her relatable, to be honest, but I could understand her by the end. If she wasn&#8217;t who she was, Emma wouldn&#8217;t be herself, after all and I did love Emma. While I have a great relationship with my mother, I have several friends who are more in the Genevieve and Emma camp and I could see so much of them in Emma.</p>\n<p><strong>Shannon</strong>: It’s funny that you say that, Kristen. My relationship with my own mother contains hints of these characters, and I’m wondering if having been raised by someone who reminds me a bit of Genevieve made her easier for me to relate to.</p>\n<p><strong>Kristen</strong>: Oh, fascinating!</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: Ha. I think I&#8217;m far more Genevieve than my own mom who is the loveliest person I know.</p>\n<p><strong>Kristen</strong>: I have come to adore the way Higgins writes mothers and daughters like Emma and Riley, however, and so I want to talk about Riley for a minute. I was impressed with how she was able to separate her relationship with her grandmother from her mother&#8217;s relationship with Genevieve. Did you all feel the same?</p>\n<p><strong>Shannon</strong>: One of my favorite things about this author’s writing is her ability to bring complex family dynamics to life on the page. The relationship between Emma and Riley is the perfect example of this. It would have been so easy for Riley to view Genevieve the way Emma did, and I loved her for not doing that. She forged a unique relationship with her, one that didn’t hinge on anyone but the two of them.</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: Absolutely. I come from a large close family and one of the rules&#8211;which, granted, is hard to follow&#8211;is that we all strive to have individual relationships with each other and not allow the dynamics of one relationship to overly influence another. Higgins does that in almost all her books&#8211;one character can have a vastly different relationship with a family member than someone else in the family does. Her sense of community doesn&#8217;t require that everyone see each other in the same way.</p>\n<p><strong>Kristen</strong>: Yeah, I come from a small family and we still struggle with triangulation, so I can imagine the more folks there are, the harder it is.</p>\n<p>I loved this thing from top to bottom, if I&#8217;m honest, and I just found the whole thing a world I could dive into and spend time in with glee. Was there anything that didn&#8217;t work for y&#8217;all?</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: Well, there is one thing. Higgins&#8217; women&#8217;s fiction is less romantic and sexual than her romances. In this book this makes the primary romance less grounded than I&#8217;d have wished. I could have used more love scenes between Emma and Miller in part because I think it would have made that relationship even more believable. Plus I like sex scenes ;).</p>\n<p><strong>Shannon</strong>: There definitely wasn’t a lot of sex, but I didn’t mind that. I loved the focus on the female relationships, and the bit of romance woven into the story was kind of an added bonus.</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: I can see that. I wish it had been more than a bit. I love her romances and the love story in this book left me wanting more of it. But, I&#8217;m also always up for powerful female relationships and this book offers those in spades.</p>\n<p><strong>Shannon</strong>: At its core, this book feels like a parenting story. We’re shown a wide array of parenting styles, some more palatable than others. Emma shines in this arena, while Genevieve kind of flounders, especially when it comes to her son Clarke. As the two of you read this, did it feel like a parent-centered story, or did you pick out another central theme?</p>\n<p><strong>Kristen</strong>: That&#8217;s an interesting question, Shannon. I think I saw it broader than that, like it&#8217;s more about family and connections that are both given and forged. Dabney, what do you think?</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: It&#8217;s a story about how the relationship between parents, children, and grandchildren are profoundly interdependent and what it takes to created and keep family. Higgins shines at showing how the most important aspect of familying is love&#8211;and this book is really about that.</p>\n<p><strong>Shannon</strong>: I love how you put that, Dabney. In more ways than one, love is a trademark of Higgins&#8217; work. She pays homage to it in all its many forms, and I&#8217;m constantly in awe of the way she brings so many different kinds of love to life on the page.</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: Yes. Whenever I read a Higgins book, I am reminded of how capacious the human heart is and how lucky we are that is so.</p>\n<p>As far as grades go, <strong>this was a B+ read</strong> for me.

                "html": "<p><em>Although beautiful young widow Phoebe, Lady Clare, has never met West Ravenel, she knows one thing for certain: he&#8217;s a mean, rotten bully. Back in boarding school, he made her late husband&#8217;s life a misery, and she&#8217;ll never forgive him for it. But when Phoebe attends a family wedding, she encounters a dashing and impossibly charming stranger who sends a fire-and-ice jolt of attraction through her. And then he introduces himself&#8230;as none other than West Ravenel.</em></p>\n<p><em>West is a man with a tarnished past. No apologies, no excuses. However, from the moment he meets Phoebe, West is consumed by irresistible desire&#8230;not to mention the bitter awareness that a woman like her is far out of his reach. What West doesn&#8217;t bargain on is that Phoebe is no straitlaced aristocratic lady. She&#8217;s the daughter of a strong-willed wallflower who long ago eloped with Sebastian, Lord St. Vincent—the most devilishly wicked rake in England.</em></p>\n<p><em>Before long, Phoebe sets out to seduce the man who has awakened her fiery nature and shown her unimaginable pleasure. Will their overwhelming passion be enough to overcome the obstacles of the past?</em></p>\n<p><em>Only the devil&#8217;s daughter knows&#8230;</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: The latest book by Kleypas is populated by characters from many of her prior historical romances. The heroine, Phoebe is Sebastian&#8217;s (<a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/devil-in-winter-by-lisa-kleypas/\"><strong>A Devil in Winter)</strong></a> daughter and the hero, Wes, is a Ravenel. So, ladies, what did you think?</p>\n<p><strong>Kristen</strong>: This book really worked for me. When I read that Phoebe was a widow with two small children I was concerned that the kids would be treacly plot devices, but instead I found the way Phoebe&#8217;s identity as &#8220;mother&#8221; grounded her to be really well executed. Now, I say that as not-a-mom, so maybe it&#8217;s more an outside-looking-in thing, but I could see why she was the way she was and the decisions she was making based on the legacy of her boys. But before I get into too much of that, Em! You mentioned offline that you loved West and I&#8217;d love to hear why he specifically worked for you.</p>\n<p><strong>Em</strong>: I also loved it. But I feel like I should confess something first. I know AAR readers love the <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/review-tag/the-wallflowers-series/\"><em>Wallflowers</em> series</a>, and <strong>Devil in Winter</strong> particularly. I barely remember it! I love Kleypas so I probably liked it&#8230;but really, it doesn’t stand out in my memory (and actually, I liked <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/it-happened-one-autumn-by-lisa-kleypas/\"><strong>It Happened One Autumn</strong></a> best!), and consequently, I haven’t read the newer <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/review-tag/the-ravenels-series/\"><em>Ravenels</em> series</a> with quite the same sense of nostalgia and fondness and expectations many of our readers/reviewers have. Perhaps that’s why I’ve enjoyed each and every one of them more than the last.</p>\n<p>Although there is a villain in this story &#8211; and a saintly dead husband, there’s very little angst. And I liked that! These two meet and it’s on. Phoebe is a widow still in love with her husband, but stoic in her sadness&#8230;And she’s a wonderful mom who cares about and adores her children. She’s self aware and keeps her emotions closely in check &#8211; except when she’s with her large family. Then we get to see her fun side&#8230;and it’s lovely. West is the best kind of reformed rake &#8211; he’s knows he was an asshole but he’s finally got his shit together and he’s finally allowing that side of himself to run the show. Their chemistry together is wonderful and every time they’re on the page together I caught myself smiling and rooting for them. I loved that the obstacles to their relationship are manageable and fixable, and that the villain of the piece doesn’t overwhelm the story or their path to happily ever after. Sigh. I loved it and them.</p>\n<p>West is my favorite kind of hero. He’s well on the path to redemption but falling in love proves to be the hardest hurdle to jump. Phoebe already has her act together &#8211; she could have anyone, but wants West. And that scares him! I love that he can’t resist her, delights in shocking her, and that his quiet goodness is clear to everyone around him. Phoebe is the peace of the puzzle he’s missing &#8211; and he knows it. I thought he was an awesome match for her and vice versa.</p>\n<p>Dabney, did you like this story? We haven’t heard from you?!</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: *winces* I did not. I didn’t hate it but it just didn’t do much for me. Perhaps my biggest complaint is that it really wasn’t clear to me why Phoebe and West fell for each other so quickly. The majority of the novel takes place over just a few days and, while I’m not averse to insta-lust stories, insta-love stories don’t work for me unless an author has clearly shown why these two people have so suddenly recharted their lives and hearts. I didn’t get that here.</p>\n<p><strong>Kristen</strong>: Hm, that’s fascinating, but I can completely see that. For me, the pivotal bit was that there was a three month gap between some of the action and one can do a lot of inner work in three months. If the feelings were lust before that gap, I can see how that gap solidified this recharting. However, if that’s not something you believe, that gap is gonna do nothing.</p>\n<p><strong>Em</strong>: I decided early on that I hated Phoebe’s dead husband &#8211; and that made me dislike her too! But she absolutely grew on me (and I made peace with her first marriage), and I loved her decision to claim West and to enjoy him while she had him. Friends: The shaving scene is particularly excellent. What did you all think of her?</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: I will confess, at the beginning of the book, I couldn’t understand Phoebe at all. She’s the product of one of the greatest love stories in all of Romancelandia (<strong>The Devil in Winter</strong>) and yet she married someone who was, it seemed, her best friend. It’s as if Aretha Franklin and Al Green had a child who thought singing was OK. So, that threw me off. Once I, sorta, got over that, I thought she was OK. I liked how she thought about her kids and I liked that she worked her way to letting herself enjoy West. But she never really gelled for me. When I finished the book, I couldn’t remember much about her at all.</p>\n<p><strong>Kristen</strong>: So I loved her beginning to end. I have a lot of time for characters who do “the right thing” out of love, rather than engaging with love themselves and that’s what I think Phoebe did. I can see how her parents’ love story was so spectacular, so singular that her brain rejected it as a possibility for her. Why shoot for the once-in-a-generation story when she could be just fine with someone who loved her? Why take that risk?</p>\n<p>That’s actually why I think I love her and Wes so much. He was a huge risk for her and once she took it, she unearthed a part of herself she had ignored. Perhaps I’m projecting too much on her, but that’s exactly how I read her.</p>\n<p><strong>Em</strong>: Re: the villain of this story. The ending felt tacked on to me and the whole situation in the club almost ruined the story (although I liked the aftermath). I had a hard time believing that Phoebe or her husband would have trusted this moron with the estate &#8211; let alone promised he would one day be master of all&#8230;That storyline felt underdeveloped and slightly ridiculous &#8211; even Phoebe knew he was trash even before all was revealed. I wish Ms. Kleypas had spent a bit more with Phoebe before she traveled to the wedding; her day to day on the estate without Henry was unclear before and after she meets West. What did you think of our villain? And Henry for that matter?</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: Neither man had much to recommend himself. And that fact made Phoebe less too. In a way, this is a “magical wang/man” story&#8211;it takes West to make Phoebe realize how to live in the world as she needs to. That’s not one of my favorite things.</p>\n<p><strong>Em</strong>: I felt like they saved each other! She needed a man like West &#8211; he’s sorted his rakish/irresponsible/reprehensible ways and settled into the man he wants to be &#8211; and that combination (playful and naughty/responsible and kind) unlocks her adventurous/wild and slightly wicked side. But he&#8217;s also &#8211; much to my delight &#8211; attracted to her mind and intelligence and her love for her boys and Henry. West needed a woman to consolidate all the redemptive qualities he’s worked on over the past few years, and Phoebe is the perfect woman for him. I thought they were very much equal to each other and their partnership was the key to unlocking the person they’re each meant to be.</p>\n<p>The villain, Edward, was just meh and so was the totally unnecessary mother-in-law. I didn’t care about either of these troublemakers, although I wish the penultimate scene wherein the villain, West and Sebastian face off together was more exciting and drawn out.

                "text": "Although beautiful young widow Phoebe, Lady Clare, has never met West Ravenel, she knows one thing for certain: he&#8217;s a mean, rotten bully. Back in boarding school, he made her late husband&#8217;s life a misery, and she&#8217;ll never forgive him for it. But when Phoebe attends a family wedding, she encounters a dashing and impossibly charming stranger who sends a fire-and-ice jolt of attraction through her. And then he introduces himself&#8230;as none other than West Ravenel. West is a man with a tarnished past. No apologies, no excuses. However, from the moment he meets Phoebe, West is consumed by irresistible desire&#8230;not to mention the bitter awareness that a woman like her is far out of his reach. What West doesn&#8217;t bargain on is that Phoebe is no straitlaced aristocratic lady. She&#8217;s the daughter of a strong-willed wallflower who long ago eloped with Sebastian, Lord St. Vincent—the most devilishly wicked rake in England. Before long, Phoebe sets out to seduce the man who has awakened her fiery nature and shown her unimaginable pleasure. Will their overwhelming passion be enough to overcome the obstacles of the past? Only the devil&#8217;s daughter knows&#8230; Dabney: The latest book by Kleypas is populated by characters from many of her prior historical romances. The heroine, Phoebe is Sebastian&#8217;s (A Devil in Winter) daughter and the hero, Wes, is a Ravenel. So, ladies, what did you think? Kristen: This book really worked for me. When I read that Phoebe was a widow with two small children I was concerned that the kids would be treacly plot devices, but instead I found the way Phoebe&#8217;s identity as &#8220;mother&#8221; grounded her to be really well executed. Now, I say that as not-a-mom, so maybe it&#8217;s more an outside-looking-in thing, but I could see why she was the way she was and the decisions she was making based on the legacy of her boys. But before I get into too much of that, Em! You mentioned offline that you loved West and I&#8217;d love to hear why he specifically worked for you. Em: I also loved it. But I feel like I should confess something first. I know AAR readers love the Wallflowers series, and Devil in Winter particularly. I barely remember it! I love Kleypas so I probably liked it&#8230;but really, it doesn’t stand out in my memory (and actually, I liked It Happened One Autumn best!), and consequently, I haven’t read the newer Ravenels series with quite the same sense of nostalgia and fondness and expectations many of our readers/reviewers have. Perhaps that’s why I’ve enjoyed each and every one of them more than the last. Although there is a villain in this story &#8211; and a saintly dead husband, there’s very little angst. And I liked that! These two meet and it’s on. Phoebe is a widow still in love with her husband, but stoic in her sadness&#8230;And she’s a wonderful mom who cares about and adores her children. She’s self aware and keeps her emotions closely in check &#8211; except when she’s with her large family. Then we get to see her fun side&#8230;and it’s lovely. West is the best kind of reformed rake &#8211; he’s knows he was an asshole but he’s finally got his shit together and he’s finally allowing that side of himself to run the show. Their chemistry together is wonderful and every time they’re on the page together I caught myself smiling and rooting for them. I loved that the obstacles to their relationship are manageable and fixable, and that the villain of the piece doesn’t overwhelm the story or their path to happily ever after. Sigh. I loved it and them. West is my favorite kind of hero. He’s well on the path to redemption but falling in love proves to be the hardest hurdle to jump. Phoebe already has her act together &#8211; she could have anyone, but wants West. And that scares him! I love that he can’t resist her, delights in shocking her, and that his quiet goodness is clear to everyone around him. Phoebe is the peace of the puzzle he’s missing &#8211; and he knows it. I thought he was an awesome match for her and vice versa. Dabney, did you like this story? We haven’t heard from you?! Dabney: *winces* I did not. I didn’t hate it but it just didn’t do much for me. Perhaps my biggest complaint is that it really wasn’t clear to me why Phoebe and West fell for each other so quickly. The majority of the novel takes place over just a few days and, while I’m not averse to insta-lust stories, insta-love stories don’t work for me unless an author has clearly shown why these two people have so suddenly recharted their lives and hearts. I didn’t get that here. Kristen: Hm, that’s fascinating, but I can completely see that. For me, the pivotal bit was that there was a three month gap between some of the action and one can do a lot of inner work in three months. If the feelings were lust before that gap, I can see how that gap solidified this recharting. However, if that’s not something you believe, that gap is gonna do nothing. Em: I decided early on that I hated Phoebe’s dead husband &#8211; and that made me dislike her too! But she absolutely grew on me (and I made peace with her first marriage), and I loved her decision to claim West and to enjoy him while she had him. Friends: The shaving scene is particularly excellent. What did you all think of her? Dabney: I will confess, at the beginning of the book, I couldn’t understand Phoebe at all. She’s the product of one of the greatest love stories in all of Romancelandia (The Devil in Winter) and yet she married someone who was, it seemed, her best friend. It’s as if Aretha Franklin and Al Green had a child who thought singing was OK. So, that threw me off. Once I, sorta, got over that, I thought she was OK. I liked how she thought about her kids and I liked that she worked her way to letting herself enjoy West. But she never really gelled for me. When I finished the book, I couldn’t remember much about her at all. Kristen: So I loved her beginning to end. I have a lot of time for characters who do “the right thing” out of love, rather than engaging with love themselves and that’s what I think Phoebe did. I can see how her parents’ love story was so spectacular, so singular that her brain rejected it as a possibility for her. Why shoot for the once-in-a-generation story when she could be just fine with someone who loved her? Why take that risk? That’s actually why I think I love her and Wes so much. He was a huge risk for her and once she took it, she unearthed a part of herself she had ignored. Perhaps I’m projecting too much on her, but that’s exactly how I read her. Em: Re: the villain of this story. The ending felt tacked on to me and the whole situation in the club almost ruined the story (although I liked the aftermath). I had a hard time believing that Phoebe or her husband would have trusted this moron with the estate &#8211; let alone promised he would one day be master of all&#8230;That storyline felt underdeveloped and slightly ridiculous &#8211; even Phoebe knew he was trash even before all was revealed. I wish Ms. Kleypas had spent a bit more with Phoebe before she traveled to the wedding; her day to day on the estate without Henry was unclear before and after she meets West. What did you think of our villain? And Henry for that matter? Dabney: Neither man had much to recommend himself. And that fact made Phoebe less too. In a way, this is a “magical wang/man” story&#8211;it takes West to make Phoebe realize how to live in the world as she needs to. That’s not one of my favorite things. Em: I felt like they saved each other! She needed a man like West &#8211; he’s sorted his rakish/irresponsible/reprehensible ways and settled into the man he wants to be &#8211; and that combination (playful and naughty/responsible and kind) unlocks her adventurous/wild and slightly wicked side. But he&#8217;s also &#8211; much to my delight &#8211; attracted to her mind and intelligence and her love for her boys and Henry. West needed a woman to consolidate all the redemptive qualities he’s worked on over the past few years, and Phoebe is the perfect woman for him. I thought they were very much equal to each other and their partnership was the key to unlocking the person they’re each meant to be. The villain, Edward, was just meh and so was the totally unnecessary mother-in-law. I didn’t care about either of these troublemakers, although I wish the penultimate scene wherein the villain, West and Sebastian face off together was more exciting and drawn out. It was seriously underwhelming. Kristen: Em, I’m with you on the saving each other. We were supposed to think the conflict that was between them was external, but I read it as much more internal. Because, yeah, the external barrier to the HEA was weaksauce. Dabney: Kleypas took a lot of heat&#8211;which she responded to by revising her book&#8211;over cultural appropriation in her last book, Hello, Stranger. This book hasn’t a whiff of controversy to it. But what it does have is a serious celebration of how masculine/virile/manly West is, especially in comparison to Phoebe’s dead husband and to her estate manager and suitor Edward. And I’m normally all over alpha heroes but, here, it felt almost heavy handed.

I also didn’t think that West read as a alpha beyond his body so it worked for me. I read this week that no two people read the same book, and that is totally the case here because I think she did save herself and get swept off her feet! Em: Same! I also did not read West as an alpha at all. Different strokes for different folks and all that. Dabney: You guys are right&#8211;West isn&#8217;t really an alpha in behavior (much). It&#8217;s more the way he&#8217;s repeatedly described. My favorite person and the one who stole every scene he is in is Sebastian, Phoebe’s famed father. Did you guys feel that way too? Em: This is where I think my ambivalence about the first series manifests itself most. I did think he stole his scenes (and I loved the bath scene with Evie). But don’t you think he’s a bit too pretty perfect? Perfect duke, dad, husband, guest, wise sage, savior, grandpa? In this case, I can swallow the insta-lust a lot easier than the perfection. He’s great &#8211; I get it. No one else gets to be a superman? Dabney: He’s Sebastian&#8211;he’s so indelible that I can’t see him any other way. He was such a scoundrel when young.

                "html": "<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2G3ajzS\">Darcy Barrett has undertaken a global survey of men. She’s travelled the world, and can categorically say that no one measures up to Tom Valeska, whose only flaw is that Darcy’s twin brother Jamie saw him first and claimed him forever as his best friend. Despite Darcy’s best efforts, Tom’s off limits and loyal to her brother, 99%. That’s the problem with finding her dream man at age eight and peaking in her photography career at age twenty—ever since, she’s had to learn to settle for good enough.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2G3ajzS\">When Darcy and Jamie inherit a tumble-down cottage from their grandmother, they’re left with strict instructions to bring it back to its former glory and sell the property. Darcy plans to be in an aisle seat halfway across the ocean as soon as the renovations start, but before she can cut and run, she finds a familiar face on her porch: house-flipper extraordinaire Tom’s arrived, he’s bearing power tools, and he’s single for the first time in almost a decade.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2G3ajzS\">Suddenly Darcy’s considering sticking around to make sure her twin doesn’t ruin the cottage’s inherent magic with his penchant for grey and chrome. She’s definitely not staying because of her new business partner’s tight t-shirts, or that perfect face that&#8217;s inspiring her to pick up her camera again. Soon sparks are flying—and it’s not the faulty wiring. It turns out one percent of Tom’s heart might not be enough for Darcy anymore. This time around, she’s switching things up. She’s going to make Tom Valeska 99 percent hers.</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Dabney:</strong> There aren&#8217;t a lot of books as anticipated as this one and I think, for me, that was a bit of a problem.</p>\n<p><strong>Kristen:</strong> Yeah, I had a hard time managing my expectations on this one. I had NONE for <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2B0Og9F\"><strong>The Hating Game</strong></a>, of course, so I sometimes wonder if that made me love it more. So yes, Dabney, I agree.</p>\n<p><strong>Haley:</strong> I tried to tell myself going in that this wouldn&#8217;t be <strong>The Hating Game</strong>, so there was no way I would like it as much. <strong>THG</strong> was one of those oddball books that comes along really rarely for me and makes me fall madly in love. The chances of that happening twice were impossible. I just wanted <strong><span class=\"m_-7656361340798270406gmail-m_7593695302416859043gmail-il\">99</span> Percent Mine</strong> to sound like Sally Thorne and, I think it did.</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney:</strong> And perhaps that&#8217;s part of why I didn&#8217;t love it. At all.</p>\n<p><strong>Kristen:</strong> Haley, did it sounding like Sally Thorne mean you liked it? Because I completely agree it felt like her voice, but man, I did not like this book. The dialogue I found witty and creative in <strong>THG</strong> felt labored here and I could not stand the protagonists &#8211; any of them!</p>\n<p><strong>Haley:</strong> It actually did. I think I must have liked it more than y&#8217;all did because, while it was no <strong>THG</strong>, I enjoyed most of <strong><span class=\"m_-7656361340798270406gmail-m_7593695302416859043gmail-il\">99 Percent </span>Mine</strong>. It had its flaws, for sure, but I enjoyed the central love story. What was it that you didn&#8217;t like about Tom and Darcy?</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney:</strong> Um. Pretty much everything. I didn&#8217;t like them especially as individuals, in large part because they didn&#8217;t make any sense to me. I didn&#8217;t like their relationship which, again, I didn&#8217;t really understand. I found them both to be unnecessarily self-destructive &#8211; Darcy borders on selfish as well &#8211; and I didn&#8217;t think either of them were ready, even by the end of the book, to truly love another.</p>\n<p><strong>Caroline:</strong> I accept that Darcy was self-destructive, but that&#8217;s part of what I found interesting about reading her story. I was interviewing an author about a different flawed heroine, and she made a comment about how literature conditions us to grapple with understanding and loving troubled male characters but our women typically need to be likeable and unchallenging. Since I&#8217;ve been guilty of that, it really stuck with me.</p>\n<p><strong>Haley:</strong> I&#8217;d have to agree, Caroline. I think she did have a self destructive urge, but it didn&#8217;t make me hate her. I can&#8217;t remember how old she and her twin are, but I had a streak in my early twenties where dating jerks, drinking, and acting selfish seemed like great ideas. Now, I will say, one of my bigger hang ups was the twin. The over protective, pushy brother trope almost never works for me. Especially as a device to keep the two love interests apart.</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney:</strong> There are heroines who are self-destructive, bitchy, cranky, and bossy that I&#8217;ve loved. Darcy is not one of them. Her self-destructiveness seemed so self-absorbed which made her a tough love story heroine. I never believed she&#8217;d really love Tom as he deserved to be loved.</p>\n<p><strong>Caroline:</strong> That&#8217;s interesting, because the one thing I believed was that she completely and utterly loved Tom!</p>\n<p>The thing that worked least for me was the pacing of the beginning of the book. The opening scene, which began with Darcy tending bar and narrated the next day or so continuously, including Tom&#8217;s arrival, dragged, especially because the author had to keep coming up with ways to avoid Tom telling Darcy what we all knew about his fiancée, Megan. If those chapters had been split over more time (a phone call with Tom, his arrival and tour, his moving in a week later, etc.), I think it would have been more effective. It seems like a small complaint, but those pages are practically the first third of the book, and it was a big issue for me getting into a reading rhythm.</p>\n<p><strong>Kristen:</strong> Man, I love how subjective art is. We all saw different things in such a fascinating way. Caroline, I&#8217;m glad you pointed out the rhythm issues in the beginning because I think that is one of my key issues: I never fell into a reading rhythm with this. Besides my feelings towards the characters &#8211; which are mostly in line with Dabney&#8217;s &#8211; I just kept feeling unsettled during the reading experience.</p>\n<p>Overall, this book was just a miss for me. I found Darcy unappealing, her relationship with her twin to be symbiotic instead of productive, and Tom to be a bit of a meh all around. I&#8217;m still struggling to sort a grade, though, because while it didn&#8217;t work for me at all I can see how it would work for others.

                "text": "Darcy Barrett has undertaken a global survey of men. She’s travelled the world, and can categorically say that no one measures up to Tom Valeska, whose only flaw is that Darcy’s twin brother Jamie saw him first and claimed him forever as his best friend. Despite Darcy’s best efforts, Tom’s off limits and loyal to her brother, 99%. That’s the problem with finding her dream man at age eight and peaking in her photography career at age twenty—ever since, she’s had to learn to settle for good enough. When Darcy and Jamie inherit a tumble-down cottage from their grandmother, they’re left with strict instructions to bring it back to its former glory and sell the property. Darcy plans to be in an aisle seat halfway across the ocean as soon as the renovations start, but before she can cut and run, she finds a familiar face on her porch: house-flipper extraordinaire Tom’s arrived, he’s bearing power tools, and he’s single for the first time in almost a decade. Suddenly Darcy’s considering sticking around to make sure her twin doesn’t ruin the cottage’s inherent magic with his penchant for grey and chrome. She’s definitely not staying because of her new business partner’s tight t-shirts, or that perfect face that&#8217;s inspiring her to pick up her camera again. Soon sparks are flying—and it’s not the faulty wiring. It turns out one percent of Tom’s heart might not be enough for Darcy anymore. This time around, she’s switching things up. She’s going to make Tom Valeska 99 percent hers. Dabney: There aren&#8217;t a lot of books as anticipated as this one and I think, for me, that was a bit of a problem. Kristen: Yeah, I had a hard time managing my expectations on this one. I had NONE for The Hating Game, of course, so I sometimes wonder if that made me love it more. So yes, Dabney, I agree. Haley: I tried to tell myself going in that this wouldn&#8217;t be The Hating Game, so there was no way I would like it as much. THG was one of those oddball books that comes along really rarely for me and makes me fall madly in love. The chances of that happening twice were impossible. I just wanted 99 Percent Mine to sound like Sally Thorne and, I think it did. Dabney: And perhaps that&#8217;s part of why I didn&#8217;t love it. At all. Kristen: Haley, did it sounding like Sally Thorne mean you liked it? Because I completely agree it felt like her voice, but man, I did not like this book. The dialogue I found witty and creative in THG felt labored here and I could not stand the protagonists &#8211; any of them! Haley: It actually did. I think I must have liked it more than y&#8217;all did because, while it was no THG, I enjoyed most of 99 Percent Mine. It had its flaws, for sure, but I enjoyed the central love story. What was it that you didn&#8217;t like about Tom and Darcy? Dabney: Um. Pretty much everything. I didn&#8217;t like them especially as individuals, in large part because they didn&#8217;t make any sense to me. I didn&#8217;t like their relationship which, again, I didn&#8217;t really understand. I found them both to be unnecessarily self-destructive &#8211; Darcy borders on selfish as well &#8211; and I didn&#8217;t think either of them were ready, even by the end of the book, to truly love another. Caroline: I accept that Darcy was self-destructive, but that&#8217;s part of what I found interesting about reading her story. I was interviewing an author about a different flawed heroine, and she made a comment about how literature conditions us to grapple with understanding and loving troubled male characters but our women typically need to be likeable and unchallenging. Since I&#8217;ve been guilty of that, it really stuck with me. Haley: I&#8217;d have to agree, Caroline. I think she did have a self destructive urge, but it didn&#8217;t make me hate her. I can&#8217;t remember how old she and her twin are, but I had a streak in my early twenties where dating jerks, drinking, and acting selfish seemed like great ideas. Now, I will say, one of my bigger hang ups was the twin. The over protective, pushy brother trope almost never works for me. Especially as a device to keep the two love interests apart. Dabney: There are heroines who are self-destructive, bitchy, cranky, and bossy that I&#8217;ve loved. Darcy is not one of them. Her self-destructiveness seemed so self-absorbed which made her a tough love story heroine. I never believed she&#8217;d really love Tom as he deserved to be loved. Caroline: That&#8217;s interesting, because the one thing I believed was that she completely and utterly loved Tom! The thing that worked least for me was the pacing of the beginning of the book. The opening scene, which began with Darcy tending bar and narrated the next day or so continuously, including Tom&#8217;s arrival, dragged, especially because the author had to keep coming up with ways to avoid Tom telling Darcy what we all knew about his fiancée, Megan. If those chapters had been split over more time (a phone call with Tom, his arrival and tour, his moving in a week later, etc.), I think it would have been more effective. It seems like a small complaint, but those pages are practically the first third of the book, and it was a big issue for me getting into a reading rhythm. Kristen: Man, I love how subjective art is. We all saw different things in such a fascinating way. Caroline, I&#8217;m glad you pointed out the rhythm issues in the beginning because I think that is one of my key issues: I never fell into a reading rhythm with this. Besides my feelings towards the characters &#8211; which are mostly in line with Dabney&#8217;s &#8211; I just kept feeling unsettled during the reading experience. Overall, this book was just a miss for me. I found Darcy unappealing, her relationship with her twin to be symbiotic instead of productive, and Tom to be a bit of a meh all around. I&#8217;m still struggling to sort a grade, though, because while it didn&#8217;t work for me at all I can see how it would work for others. I&#8217;ve landed on a C for that reason. Dabney: I read it less than a month ago and when I think about what I like about it, the only thing that really comes to mind is Darcy&#8217;s utterly fabulous best friend Truly. (I have taken to calling myself plush-sized every chance I get.) She and Darcy were lovely together. The novel sparkled every time Truly showed up and that made me even more aware of how the rest of the book did not. And, by the way, I have boy/girl twins who are in their twenties. Darcy and her brother Jamie were just weird &#8211; I kept trying to imagine people behaving as they did and I just couldn&#8217;t.For me, this book is a C as well.

But a desire beyond reason threatens to destroy the armor around their hearts. Now a shattering decision looms: Will Tristan betray his own code of honor…or choose a love that might be the truest thing he’s ever known?</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: SHE&#8217;S BACK! And, man am I happy about that. Don&#8217;t get me wrong&#8211;I enjoyed all of Long&#8217;s <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/review-tag/hellcat-canyon-series/\"><em>Hellcat Canyon</em> </a>books. But. There&#8217;s no writer of historical romance I love more than I love JAL and her <em><a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/review-tag/pennyroyal-green-series/\">Pennyroyal Green series</a></em>. So I was over the moon when I heard she was returning to HR. And what a return!</p>\n<p><strong>Kristen</strong>: Yes! Since I&#8217;m a bit of a late joiner to Romancelandia, I read all of the <em>Pennyroyal</em> series as part of Ms. Long&#8217;s back catalogue. When I heard she was releasing a new historical series, I was thrilled to be getting in on the ground floor, as it were. I eagerly read this tale in one greedy sitting and adored it pretty much top to bottom.</p>\n<p>Well, now that I&#8217;ve tipped my hand&#8230; ladies, what say you?</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: I too love this book. So many things about it are my jam&#8211;the wonderfully witty banter, the smouldering tension between the leads, the developed and integral cast of characters. And the writing is as good as any in Long&#8217;s catalog.</p>\n<p><strong>Alexandra</strong>: I couldn&#8217;t agree more. I&#8217;ve always enjoyed Long&#8217;s writing, but this book has to be one of my favorites. I particularly liked the character of Delilah, Lady Derring. She comes across as innocent and naive in the beginning, but then surprised me with her wit and, well, daring.</p>\n<p><strong>Kristen</strong>: In my professional life, I spend a lot of time with women who own businesses and many who started ones because they had no other choice, much like Delilah. There is such an air of &#8220;right, let&#8217;s get on with it&#8221; about this book that I found gorgeously authentic to the women I work alongside and gave me such a deep affection for the character. Delilah could have easily wallowed in her circumstances, emotionally anyway, and instead took a deep breath and made it work.</p>\n<p>How did you ladies react to the initial reveal of Derring&#8217;s mistress?</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: I thought it was a win. And I love how her character, Angelique, evolved over the course of the book. (Slight spoiler ahead!) For me, as lovely as the relationship between Delilah and Tristan is, the relationship between Delilah and Angelique is every bit as wondrous. I was trying to think if Long has ever written such a strong female friendship in any of her other historicals. I adore these two.</p>\n<p><strong>Alexandra</strong>: I loved that element too&#8211;it some ways, this book felt like Women&#8217;s Fiction wrapped in a Historical Romance. At the core there was a focus on Delilah discovering her own strength as she confronts her husband&#8217;s mistress and starts her own business. I also particularly liked that those elements stood apart from Delilah&#8217;s relationship with Tristan. Although he&#8217;s supportive, her accomplishments are due to her own hard work, not Tristan riding in to save her.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve talked a lot about what we loved in this book. Was there anything you ladies had problems with?</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: The romance is a bit of a slower burn than I usually like but the banter between Delilah and Tristan is so brilliant that bothered me less than it might have.</p>\n<p><strong>Kristen</strong>: I can find niggly things for sure &#8211; a few lines of dialogue that felt clunky and I&#8217;m with Dabney that it took longer to move than I prefer, but honestly? Nothing that deterred from my unadulterated love for this thing. It ticked every box I wanted it to and gave me such a happy book feeling. I was craving a good friendship story more than I even knew, and this delivered.</p>\n<p>Also. More Angelique ASAP please and thank you. This one is a A+ from me &#8211; I think that&#8217;s the third one I&#8217;ve ever given out.</p>\n<p><strong>Alexandra</strong>: I&#8217;m right there with you Kristen, it easily earned an A in my book. There was nothing major that I found to dislike, and I actually enjoyed the slow burn aspect of the romance. It felt right to me, as it allowed time for Delilah to find her footing after her husband&#8217;s death and realize her own internal strength. By the time she officially begins an affair with Tristan, she&#8217;s doing so as an independent woman seeking companionship, not a damsel in distress seeking a knight in shining armor. For me, that was one of the elements that made this not just a good book, but a great one.</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: I&#8217;m going with an A too. (I&#8217;ve never given ANY book an A+.) Not only is this a delight to read, it sets up a context, just as she did with the town of Pennyroyal Green, I love and can&#8217;t wait to read more of.  Here&#8217;s hoping Angelique&#8217;s story comes out soon!</p>\n<h3><strong>Buy it at: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2T6PMhA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon</a>/<a href=\"https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/book/lady-derring-takes-a-lover/id1336074185?mt=11&amp;at=1010lmPQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apple Books</a>/<a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8039827/type/dlg/fragment/%2F/https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/lady-derring-takes-a-lover-julie-anne-long/1128796063?ean=9780062867476\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Barnes &amp; Noble</a>/<a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=b95pXvP*dp4&amp;offerid=635768.100059780062867476&amp;type=2&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Febook%2Flady-derring-takes-a-lover\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kobo</a></strong></h3>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Visit our </strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2SeEiZg\"><strong>Amazon Storefront</strong></a></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

And the writing is as good as any in Long&#8217;s catalog. Alexandra: I couldn&#8217;t agree more. I&#8217;ve always enjoyed Long&#8217;s writing, but this book has to be one of my favorites. I particularly liked the character of Delilah, Lady Derring. She comes across as innocent and naive in the beginning, but then surprised me with her wit and, well, daring. Kristen: In my professional life, I spend a lot of time with women who own businesses and many who started ones because they had no other choice, much like Delilah. There is such an air of &#8220;right, let&#8217;s get on with it&#8221; about this book that I found gorgeously authentic to the women I work alongside and gave me such a deep affection for the character. Delilah could have easily wallowed in her circumstances, emotionally anyway, and instead took a deep breath and made it work. How did you ladies react to the initial reveal of Derring&#8217;s mistress? Dabney: I thought it was a win. And I love how her character, Angelique, evolved over the course of the book. (Slight spoiler ahead!) For me, as lovely as the relationship between Delilah and Tristan is, the relationship between Delilah and Angelique is every bit as wondrous. I was trying to think if Long has ever written such a strong female friendship in any of her other historicals. I adore these two. Alexandra: I loved that element too&#8211;it some ways, this book felt like Women&#8217;s Fiction wrapped in a Historical Romance. At the core there was a focus on Delilah discovering her own strength as she confronts her husband&#8217;s mistress and starts her own business. I also particularly liked that those elements stood apart from Delilah&#8217;s relationship with Tristan. Although he&#8217;s supportive, her accomplishments are due to her own hard work, not Tristan riding in to save her. We&#8217;ve talked a lot about what we loved in this book. Was there anything you ladies had problems with? Dabney: The romance is a bit of a slower burn than I usually like but the banter between Delilah and Tristan is so brilliant that bothered me less than it might have. Kristen: I can find niggly things for sure &#8211; a few lines of dialogue that felt clunky and I&#8217;m with Dabney that it took longer to move than I prefer, but honestly? Nothing that deterred from my unadulterated love for this thing. It ticked every box I wanted it to and gave me such a happy book feeling. I was craving a good friendship story more than I even knew, and this delivered. Also. More Angelique ASAP please and thank you. This one is a A+ from me &#8211; I think that&#8217;s the third one I&#8217;ve ever given out. Alexandra: I&#8217;m right there with you Kristen, it easily earned an A in my book. There was nothing major that I found to dislike, and I actually enjoyed the slow burn aspect of the romance. It felt right to me, as it allowed time for Delilah to find her footing after her husband&#8217;s death and realize her own internal strength. By the time she officially begins an affair with Tristan, she&#8217;s doing so as an independent woman seeking companionship, not a damsel in distress seeking a knight in shining armor. For me, that was one of the elements that made this not just a good book, but a great one. Dabney: I&#8217;m going with an A too. (I&#8217;ve never given ANY book an A+.) Not only is this a delight to read, it sets up a context, just as she did with the town of Pennyroyal Green, I love and can&#8217;t wait to read more of.  Here&#8217;s hoping Angelique&#8217;s story comes out soon!

                "html": "<p>Jill Sorenson’s<strong> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/1WrYUJ2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Against the Wall</a> </strong>might be my favorite of Ms. Sorenson’s books. Many of her most memorable characters are genuinely hampered by their life choices, often to the point that there really isn’t a scott-free HEA in their future. This is definitely true for Eric Hernandez, the hero of <strong>Against the Wall</strong>. Eric first appeared in Sorenson’s 2011 <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/the-edge-of-night/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>The Edge of Night</strong></a> and, at the end of that book, went to jail for crimes he did indeed commit.</p>\n<p>In <strong>Against the Wall</strong>, Eric has now served his time and is trying to build a new life. He is, however, still in love with Meghan–also from <strong>The Edge of Night</strong>–who is, as she was five years ago, out of his reach.</p>\n<p>Sorenson writes characters who struggle to survive. The barriers Eric faces as an ex-con of color are palpably real. Eric is poor <em>and</em> Hispanic, and the choices he is forced to make are often heartbreaking. Furthermore, the mistakes he&#8217;s made are ones 21st century America is unlikely to forgive. Sorenson&#8217;s deft plotting, however, gives us hope that maybe, just maybe, Eric can become the man he is determined to be.</p>\n<p>Meghan, who is white and middle-class, is also a believable character. Like many a college student, she isn’t sure what she wants from life or from herself. Meghan too makes mistakes but her class and color make hers easier for her to recover from. Eric and Meghan are the sort of lovers you desperately want to have an HEA and, for much of this tautly written book, that outcome seems impossible.</p>\n<p>I love everything about this book.

                "text": "Jill Sorenson’s Against the Wall might be my favorite of Ms. Sorenson’s books. Many of her most memorable characters are genuinely hampered by their life choices, often to the point that there really isn’t a scott-free HEA in their future. This is definitely true for Eric Hernandez, the hero of Against the Wall. Eric first appeared in Sorenson’s 2011 The Edge of Night and, at the end of that book, went to jail for crimes he did indeed commit. In Against the Wall, Eric has now served his time and is trying to build a new life. He is, however, still in love with Meghan–also from The Edge of Night–who is, as she was five years ago, out of his reach. Sorenson writes characters who struggle to survive. The barriers Eric faces as an ex-con of color are palpably real. Eric is poor and Hispanic, and the choices he is forced to make are often heartbreaking. Furthermore, the mistakes he&#8217;s made are ones 21st century America is unlikely to forgive. Sorenson&#8217;s deft plotting, however, gives us hope that maybe, just maybe, Eric can become the man he is determined to be. Meghan, who is white and middle-class, is also a believable character. Like many a college student, she isn’t sure what she wants from life or from herself. Meghan too makes mistakes but her class and color make hers easier for her to recover from. Eric and Meghan are the sort of lovers you desperately want to have an HEA and, for much of this tautly written book, that outcome seems impossible. I love everything about this book. It&#8217;s gritty, sexy&#8211;like, really really hot&#8211;, and, in places, oh so sad. Sorenson’s prose crackles with life–this book transports you to its context. Eric and Meghan aren’t able to keep their hands off or their hearts closed to each other but their path is a fraught one. This is a book that once you start reading, you&#8217;ll keep reading. It&#8217;s just so good. I recommend it without reservation. Buy it at Amazon/iBooks/Barnes and Noble/Kobo"

In <b>Breathless</b>, Benedick was last seen married to a woman he loved with one son and another child on the way. In <b>Shameless</b>, somewhat confusingly, Benedick has now lost two wives to childbirth and has no children. (No explanation is given for what happened to his first son.) In <b>Shameless</b>, Benedick is a rake who no longer believes in love although he, like all in the men in the <b><i>Rohan </i></b>series, is a big fan of sexual congress in all its varied forms.</p>\n<p>As the story begins, Benedick has come to London to do two things: find a biddable, boring bride and get laid. The first task is a necessary chore—he’s an eldest son and must have an heir. The second task he plans to accomplish with the help of one of London’s most talented fellatrices, Violet Highstreet. Benedick sends Vi a note asking her to come and attend to him. Violet dashes to his side, sinks to her knees and… suddenly, the door to Viscount Rohan’s salon flies open, admitting a strident woman he’s never seen before. The “virago” sternly tells Violet to “get up” and stop degrading herself! Violet protests she likes degrading herself in this particular fashion. The woman at the door, Lady Charity Carstairs, in a long-suffering voice, reminds Violet she has chosen to leave behind  her livelihood of salacious acts and instead reside in Carstairs House, a home for fallen women. Violet rather ungraciously opts for housing over whoring and, much to Benedick’s sorrow, leaves his house with the all no-play and all no-fun Lady Charity.</p>\n<p>The widowed Lady Charity Carstairs, at age 29, is a genuine prude. Her marriage to a much older man did nothing to convince her of the pull of passion and, as a widow, she’s had one brief, pitiable affair that left her sure men have nothing to offer. She’s confident, or so she tells herself, she’s content improving the lives of the gaggle of fallen women she saves from the streets.  So, despite thinking Benedick Rohan might be the best looking man she’s ever seen, she wants nothing to do with him until one of her “girls” is brutally beaten.</p>\n<p>Charity is sure the girl was so abused by the nefarious group of upper-class debauchees who form the Heavenly Host. The Host has figured in each of the Rohan books and, though the group has always been unsettling and seriously off-putting, they’ve never been truly criminal and violent until now. Under their new mysterious leader, not only has the Host begun viciously beating unwilling young women, rumor has it they plan to sacrifice a virgin on the next full moon.</p>\n<p>Charity asks Benedick for his help destroying the Heavenly Host, a group his family founded years ago. Initially, Benedick, who has nothing to do with the group, doesn’t care the Host have become so dissolute. Then Charity informs him his younger brother Brandon, a post-war wreck of a man, is involved with the group’s horrific plans. Worried for his opium addicted brother—and drawn to Charity&#8211;, Benedick agrees to work with her to destroy the Host.</p>\n<p>I wasn’t crazy about the suspense plot in <b>Shameless</b>. It was clear to me who the mysterious head of the Host was and I had a hard time buying Benedick’s brother Brandon doing anything truly evil.  I was also bored with the Heavenly Host. They have been in every <b><i>Rohan </i></b>novel and, at this point, they’re rather like garish wallpaper—you see them but other than making you cringe, they don’t have much impact on things that matter. Additionally, I was saddened there wasn’t Ms. Stuart’s trademark <b><i>Rohan</i> </b>secondary romance in this novel. While it’s clear there’s something between Brandon and Emma, Charity’s best friend and former madam extraordinaire, nothing of real interest passes between them in this book. I hoped for more for Brandon and Emma in this tale.</p>\n<p>But the primary love story, I loved. Charity has only had unsatisfactory sex and has never experienced romantic love. Benedick has had a superb sex life and has truly loved—he adored his first wife. Charity holds her heart apart because she doesn’t know what she’s missing; Benedick, his because he’s terrified of the pain that comes with loving and losing. As the two move into each other’s arms and emotions, they both slowly learn the value of risking one’s heart. Ms. Stuart always writes well about the way passion can bind. In <b>Shameless</b>, she writes not only about the power of sex but of the joy of companionship, and of the pleasure in finding that special someone you most enjoy sharing your day—and life—with. In this book, she writes convincingly of falling sweetly as well as passionately in love. It’s a treat to see Ms. Stuart, who does dark romance so well, write with great verve and skill about a lighter kind of love.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Buy it at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2KhVXuy\">Amazon</a>/<a href=\"https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/book/shameless/id445590291?mt=11&amp;at=1010lmPQ\">iBooks</a>/<a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8039827/type/dlg/https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/shameless-anne-stuart/1101103462?ean=9781459207622\">Barnes and Noble</a>/<a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=b95pXvP*dp4&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=551651.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=9310&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Febook%2Fshameless-3\">Kobo</a></strong></h3>\n",

This go-round, it impressed the hell out of me. It resonated in a way contemporary romance rarely does with me.</p>\n<p>Adam Collins and Marissa Brooks grew up in the small town of Walker’s Ford, South Dakota. It&#8217;s a place where people drive pickup trucks, live in the same houses they grew up in, and where it feels almost impossible to become anyone other than who you once were. Calhoun&#8217;s rural America is more than credible&#8211;people worry about paying the bills, drink crappy coffee in worn booths, and rely on the library to show them worlds other than their own.</p>\n<p>When Adam and Marissa were seventeen they were in crazy, wildly in love. Though they never had actual sex, they spent every moment they could in each others&#8217; arms. When they thought about the future, Adam dreamed about exploring the world on his beloved motorcycle and Marissa longed to buy and restore her family&#8217;s ancestral home, Brookhaven.</p>\n<p>Adam destroyed one of those dreams one horrible night and the next day, he left town and joined the Marines. Twelve years later, he returns to Walker’s Ford, having left the Corps. On the night he returns, he walks into Brookhaven, now almost fully restored and owned by Marissa, to attend the engagement party of Adam’s best friend, Keith who is marrying Delaney, a woman Adam was engaged to for years and whom he broke up with eight months ago for reasons that no one really knows.</p>\n<p>Adam&#8217;s attention, however, isn&#8217;t on the celebrating couple, it&#8217;s on Marissa and, within an hour, the two are having the sex Adam denied them in high school. Within days, they are lovers.</p>\n<p>Marissa lets Adam into her body but she&#8217;s determined not to let him back into her heart. Though Adam says he&#8217;s back in South Dakota to stay&#8211;he plans to study architecture at a nearby university&#8211;she doesn&#8217;t believe he won&#8217;t again leave her and Walker&#8217;s Ford. And, she might be right.

                "text": "I&#8217;m not sure why I decided to re-read Unforgiven. I&#8217;d read it years ago and thought it was good but not great. This go-round, it impressed the hell out of me. It resonated in a way contemporary romance rarely does with me. Adam Collins and Marissa Brooks grew up in the small town of Walker’s Ford, South Dakota. It&#8217;s a place where people drive pickup trucks, live in the same houses they grew up in, and where it feels almost impossible to become anyone other than who you once were. Calhoun&#8217;s rural America is more than credible&#8211;people worry about paying the bills, drink crappy coffee in worn booths, and rely on the library to show them worlds other than their own. When Adam and Marissa were seventeen they were in crazy, wildly in love. Though they never had actual sex, they spent every moment they could in each others&#8217; arms. When they thought about the future, Adam dreamed about exploring the world on his beloved motorcycle and Marissa longed to buy and restore her family&#8217;s ancestral home, Brookhaven. Adam destroyed one of those dreams one horrible night and the next day, he left town and joined the Marines. Twelve years later, he returns to Walker’s Ford, having left the Corps. On the night he returns, he walks into Brookhaven, now almost fully restored and owned by Marissa, to attend the engagement party of Adam’s best friend, Keith who is marrying Delaney, a woman Adam was engaged to for years and whom he broke up with eight months ago for reasons that no one really knows. Adam&#8217;s attention, however, isn&#8217;t on the celebrating couple, it&#8217;s on Marissa and, within an hour, the two are having the sex Adam denied them in high school. Within days, they are lovers. Marissa lets Adam into her body but she&#8217;s determined not to let him back into her heart. Though Adam says he&#8217;s back in South Dakota to stay&#8211;he plans to study architecture at a nearby university&#8211;she doesn&#8217;t believe he won&#8217;t again leave her and Walker&#8217;s Ford. And, she might be right. Adam keeps his emotions on lock-down and, despite the the heat that burns between them&#8211;and whoa does it burn&#8211;, he&#8217;s still so damaged by what happened seventeen years ago. Adam and Marissa are tethered to the past in heartrending ways and their story is absorbing. Change is difficult for both of them and it&#8217;s hard to watch them so limit their lives. Neither believes they deserve joy or love let alone a coupled happy ending.

                "html": "<blockquote><p>But for the first time, I feel the power of praying words alongside someone else, the power of praying words so familiar and ancient they come from some hitherto unknown part of my mind. The part of my mind that isn’t consumed with accounting and finance, the part that isn’t even rational or entirely civilized. It’s a part of me so deep, so elemental, I can’t even name it. But it responds to the old words like trees to wind, rustling awake, stretching roots deep, deep down. The words don’t care about my feelings, about my petty sulks and mortal frustrations. The words are there anyway, just as the humanness inside me is there anyway, and for one clear, shimmering moment, I understand.</p>\n<p>I understand how you can convict God of terrible crimes and then go to evening prayer.</p>\n<p>I understand that hate was never, ever the opposite of belief. I understand that belief isn’t a coat to be put on and worn in all kinds of weather, even the blistering sun.</p>\n<p>Belief is this. Praying when you don’t feel like it, when you don’t know who or what is listening; it’s doing the actions with the trust that something about it matters. That something about it makes you more human, a better human, a human able to love and trust and hope in a world where those things are hard.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>from <strong>Sinner</strong> by Sierra Simone</em></p>\n<p>There’s also butt sex.</p>\n<p><strong>Sinner</strong> is somewhat of a miracle. It&#8217;s a book in which a profound commitment to understanding faith AND a plethora of scorching sex scenes are each well-written and intrinsic to the story. It&#8217;s an erotic romance that makes you think, hard, about spiritual, ethical, and metaphysical questions.</p>\n<p><strong>Sinner</strong> is the third book in Simone&#8217;s <em>Priest</em> series&#8211;I haven&#8217;t read the first two&#8211;and functions as a stand-alone. It&#8217;s the tale of thirty-six year old millionaire libertine Sean Bell and 21 year old virgin Zenobia Iverson. (The two reminded me, incongruously, of a modern day <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/devil-in-winter-by-lisa-kleypas/\">Sebastian and Evie.</a>) Zenny is the young sister of Sean&#8217;s oldest friend and is beyond forbidden to Sean for any number of reasons, several of which I agree with. (I believe strongly in the half your age plus seven for romantic pairings.*)</p>\n<p>When the novel begins, Zenny and Sean meet hot at a party. He doesn&#8217;t recognize her. (She, however, knows exactly who he is.) They flirt, Sean talks some <em>serious</em> sex smack, and they begin to kiss but are interrupted&#8211;Sean has to race to the hospital where his mother, a terminal cancer patient, has been taken to the ER. The two part and Sean&#8211;he narrates the book&#8211;thinks he&#8217;ll never again see &#8220;Mary.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This is, of course, not the case. The next day, Sean&#8217;s boss sends him to finesse kicking a bunch of nuns out of the shelter they run&#8211;Sean is a deal closer extraordinaire&#8211;and, wouldn&#8217;t you know it, Mary turns out to be Zenny <strong>and</strong> a postulant there. She also turns out to want Sean to show her all she&#8217;ll be missing when, in a month, she marries the church and foreswears sex and men forever. And she does mean all.</p>\n<p>This is not a story line that calls to me in any way. And yet&#8230;.</p>\n<p>I like this book a lot. Simone is at ease in both the smutty and the spiritual&#8211;even better, she sees the connection between the two. As Sean&#8217;s brother Tyler tells him:</p>\n<blockquote><p>To be fully human is to be fully sexual, and while that doesn’t mean having sex or even sexual desire, it does mean being fully in your body.

                "text": "But for the first time, I feel the power of praying words alongside someone else, the power of praying words so familiar and ancient they come from some hitherto unknown part of my mind. The part of my mind that isn’t consumed with accounting and finance, the part that isn’t even rational or entirely civilized. It’s a part of me so deep, so elemental, I can’t even name it. But it responds to the old words like trees to wind, rustling awake, stretching roots deep, deep down. The words don’t care about my feelings, about my petty sulks and mortal frustrations. The words are there anyway, just as the humanness inside me is there anyway, and for one clear, shimmering moment, I understand. I understand how you can convict God of terrible crimes and then go to evening prayer. I understand that hate was never, ever the opposite of belief. I understand that belief isn’t a coat to be put on and worn in all kinds of weather, even the blistering sun. Belief is this. Praying when you don’t feel like it, when you don’t know who or what is listening; it’s doing the actions with the trust that something about it matters. That something about it makes you more human, a better human, a human able to love and trust and hope in a world where those things are hard. from Sinner by Sierra Simone There’s also butt sex. Sinner is somewhat of a miracle. It&#8217;s a book in which a profound commitment to understanding faith AND a plethora of scorching sex scenes are each well-written and intrinsic to the story. It&#8217;s an erotic romance that makes you think, hard, about spiritual, ethical, and metaphysical questions. Sinner is the third book in Simone&#8217;s Priest series&#8211;I haven&#8217;t read the first two&#8211;and functions as a stand-alone. It&#8217;s the tale of thirty-six year old millionaire libertine Sean Bell and 21 year old virgin Zenobia Iverson. (The two reminded me, incongruously, of a modern day Sebastian and Evie.) Zenny is the young sister of Sean&#8217;s oldest friend and is beyond forbidden to Sean for any number of reasons, several of which I agree with. (I believe strongly in the half your age plus seven for romantic pairings.*) When the novel begins, Zenny and Sean meet hot at a party. He doesn&#8217;t recognize her. (She, however, knows exactly who he is.) They flirt, Sean talks some serious sex smack, and they begin to kiss but are interrupted&#8211;Sean has to race to the hospital where his mother, a terminal cancer patient, has been taken to the ER. The two part and Sean&#8211;he narrates the book&#8211;thinks he&#8217;ll never again see &#8220;Mary.&#8221; This is, of course, not the case. The next day, Sean&#8217;s boss sends him to finesse kicking a bunch of nuns out of the shelter they run&#8211;Sean is a deal closer extraordinaire&#8211;and, wouldn&#8217;t you know it, Mary turns out to be Zenny and a postulant there. She also turns out to want Sean to show her all she&#8217;ll be missing when, in a month, she marries the church and foreswears sex and men forever. And she does mean all. This is not a story line that calls to me in any way. And yet&#8230;. I like this book a lot. Simone is at ease in both the smutty and the spiritual&#8211;even better, she sees the connection between the two. As Sean&#8217;s brother Tyler tells him: To be fully human is to be fully sexual, and while that doesn’t mean having sex or even sexual desire, it does mean being fully in your body. It means recognizing that there’s nothing any less holy about your body than there is about your soul, that as long as your body is treated with consent and respect and affection— and that you treat the bodies of others in the same way— there’s nothing inherently sinful about your flesh. Faith, and what it means to live a life guided by it, is the heart of this story. Zenny and Sean go through all the expected stages of a contemporary romance as they find their way to their HEA. The reader is rarely surprised by their story but, whoa, the discussions they have as they work their way there are intricate and enthralling. Sean, with Zenny&#8217;s help, learns to understand God, death, and love in profound, life-affirming ways. There are flaws&#8211;yes. There&#8217;s a reveal about a secondary character that was as surprising as an anvil. Zenny is too young for Sean. The first person narration feels, at times, limiting. But, damn, if you&#8217;re looking for a book that successfully combines sex and (the path to) salvation, read this book. Sean, Zenny, their families&#8211;I &lt;3 Sean&#8217;s mom so hard&#8211;and their discussions have stayed with me long after I finished Sinner.

She is certain they make the perfect couple and that he’s just waiting for the right moment to ask her to be his bride.

Earlier in the month, he caught her scapegrace brother Ian naked in bed with Alex’s now ex-fiancée.

Her control over herself is thoughtful rather than guarded. She’s very witty and her insights into others — especially Alex — are dead on. She’s the sort of heroine one longs to actually know. Alex <b><i>is</i></b> a cold and often cruel man —it’s clear he deserves his terrifying reputation. He is also fiercely intelligent and very lonely.

He widened his own eyes with alarm, recoiling slightly. “I…I beg your pardon — Horses. Honestly, Miss Eversea,” he stammered. “I do wonder what you think of me if that’s what you heard.” He shook his head ruefully. “Horses. Those hooved beasts a man can race, wager upon, plow a field with, harness to a phaeton and drive at deliciously reckless speeds.”</p>\n<p>She stared at him now as he walked…. “And one cannot do any of that with whores?” she asked softly….</p>\n<p>His heart picked up a beat or two. “It’s a frustrating truism,” he allowed resignedly, “but it’s a rare whore who’ll consent to be harnessed to a plow.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>As Alex and Genevieve move from witty wordplay to passionate foreplay, the relationship between them shifts and what began as a story about a young maiden and an older rake becomes something much more nuanced.

She wears brightly colored contact lenses, dyes her long hair colors never found in nature, favors biker boots, unusual outfits, and facial piercings.

For years, every choice he&#8217;s made has been predicated at making sure his sister, mother, and business are safe.

He tells her she can do better, in fact, she damn well better do better. She says, unless he wants to be the one, he can damn well stop telling her what to do. At first Vince says he&#8217;s not interested but after a few days of Kara sending him provocative texts of the guys she&#8217;s considering, he makes her an offer.</p>\n<blockquote><p>You know what I’m offering, baby girl.

Taking away the burden of her inexperience so she didn’t have to worry about it. And even more important than that, he was giving her a role to play. A mask to wear. Some extra armor to protect herself in a situation where she felt unprotected. A way to feel less vulnerable.</p>\n<p>She didn’t have to be Kara, the freaky-ass chick with the weird hair who dressed funny. The girl nobody, not even her family, wanted.

Their HEA made me cry. I loved their story and, if you like demanding erotic romance, you will too. &nbsp; Buy it at A/iB/BN/K"

I can think of no one who does them consistently brilliantly&#8230; no one but Courtney Milan.</p>\n<p>Ms. Milan&#8217;s novellas are, as a rule, superb. <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2hQpQYF\"><strong>This Wicked Gift</strong></a>, <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2hHgqeF\"><strong>The Governess Affair</strong></a>, and <strong><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2hHpEb0\">A Kiss for Midwinter</a> </strong>are<strong> </strong>all small(ish) prose wonders, each presenting a fully-fledged story in less than 125 pages.</p>\n<p>But my favorite novella by Ms. Milan is the first I read, <strong>Unlocked</strong>. This story is, tangentially, a part of the <em>Turner</em> series which I also love. The heroine of this story, Lady Elaine Warren, is a friend to Margaret, the steel-spined heroine of the first book in the series, <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2gTYzof\"><strong>Unveiled</strong></a>. Elaine, when the reader meets her, is ruined. Not by a seducing rake or a plummeting fortune, but by that most constant of devastations: bullying.</p>\n<p>Ten years ago, when Elaine first came out, she laughed and society&#8211;and in particular a darling gent of the ton, Evan Carlton, the Earl of Westfeld&#8211;shuddered. Elaine&#8217;s laugh was a bray, an embarrassment, and an easy target for those looking to make their mark. Evan, then young and callow, made her a joke&#8211;<em>Lady Equine</em>&#8211;and, really, that was it for Elaine.</p>\n<p>Now, Evan has returned to London, a very different man than when he left, and he sees, with terrible clarity, the woman she&#8217;s become:</p>\n<blockquote><p>She made herself easy to overlook. Her arms were drawn tightly about her waist, as if she could squeeze herself into insignificance. Her gown, a pink so anemic it might have been white, left her muted in the crowd of bright colors. Even the pale color of her hair, twisted into an indifferent chignon, seemed to declare her inconsequential. It was only his own memory that made her stand out.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For Elaine, Evan&#8217;s return is terrifying.</p>\n<blockquote><p>She had fallen into a nightmare: the kind where she entered a ballroom wearing nothing but her drawers. She’d had that dream before. Soon, everyone would start laughing at her. And when they turned to her en masse, the people who pointed and mocked all wore the same face: a thousand incarnations of Evan Carlton—now the Earl of Westfeld.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In the years since Evan left to&#8211;literally&#8211;climb mountains, Elaine has, much to her satisfaction, survived. She and her equally maligned mother&#8211;Lady Stockhurst is an astronomer whose fearsome intelligence make her the target of ridicule&#8211;continue to go to balls and to teas at which Elaine thinks every moment, every day, &#8220;<em>You cannot break me. You cannot hurt me. You cannot even make me notice you.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>Over the next 150 pages&#8211;the story is 181 pages long&#8211;Evan and Elaine remake their story both for themselves and for the ton. Ms. Milan takes no shortcuts here. Evan knows he wronged Elaine grievously and yet, we the readers, privy to his thoughts, long for Elaine to see him as the man he has now is. And yet there is no way for Elaine to do so without first processing the anger and the pain his cruelty caused her. Elaine, like the very best of heroines, has learned to value herself. Evan must earn her trust, her respect, and, if the reader is very very lucky, her love.</p>\n<p>The story of Elaine and Evan is riveting enough on its own. Ms. Milan adds to it the redemption of Lady Stockhurst&#8217;s reputation as well. The way in which Elaine and her mother are made whole in the eyes of those who have demeaned them for over a decade is so glorious&#8230; really, it&#8217;s just sublime.</p>\n<p>So, if you have an hour or two and want to immerse yourself in a fiction that inspires, moves, and persuasively entertains, pick up <strong>Unlocked</strong>.

I can think of no one who does them consistently brilliantly&#8230; no one but Courtney Milan. Ms. Milan&#8217;s novellas are, as a rule, superb. This Wicked Gift, The Governess Affair, and A Kiss for Midwinter are all small(ish) prose wonders, each presenting a fully-fledged story in less than 125 pages. But my favorite novella by Ms. Milan is the first I read, Unlocked. This story is, tangentially, a part of the Turner series which I also love. The heroine of this story, Lady Elaine Warren, is a friend to Margaret, the steel-spined heroine of the first book in the series, Unveiled. Elaine, when the reader meets her, is ruined. Not by a seducing rake or a plummeting fortune, but by that most constant of devastations: bullying. Ten years ago, when Elaine first came out, she laughed and society&#8211;and in particular a darling gent of the ton, Evan Carlton, the Earl of Westfeld&#8211;shuddered. Elaine&#8217;s laugh was a bray, an embarrassment, and an easy target for those looking to make their mark. Evan, then young and callow, made her a joke&#8211;Lady Equine&#8211;and, really, that was it for Elaine. Now, Evan has returned to London, a very different man than when he left, and he sees, with terrible clarity, the woman she&#8217;s become: She made herself easy to overlook. Her arms were drawn tightly about her waist, as if she could squeeze herself into insignificance. Her gown, a pink so anemic it might have been white, left her muted in the crowd of bright colors. Even the pale color of her hair, twisted into an indifferent chignon, seemed to declare her inconsequential. It was only his own memory that made her stand out. For Elaine, Evan&#8217;s return is terrifying. She had fallen into a nightmare: the kind where she entered a ballroom wearing nothing but her drawers. She’d had that dream before. Soon, everyone would start laughing at her. And when they turned to her en masse, the people who pointed and mocked all wore the same face: a thousand incarnations of Evan Carlton—now the Earl of Westfeld. In the years since Evan left to&#8211;literally&#8211;climb mountains, Elaine has, much to her satisfaction, survived. She and her equally maligned mother&#8211;Lady Stockhurst is an astronomer whose fearsome intelligence make her the target of ridicule&#8211;continue to go to balls and to teas at which Elaine thinks every moment, every day, &#8220;You cannot break me. You cannot hurt me. You cannot even make me notice you.&#8221; Over the next 150 pages&#8211;the story is 181 pages long&#8211;Evan and Elaine remake their story both for themselves and for the ton. Ms. Milan takes no shortcuts here. Evan knows he wronged Elaine grievously and yet, we the readers, privy to his thoughts, long for Elaine to see him as the man he has now is. And yet there is no way for Elaine to do so without first processing the anger and the pain his cruelty caused her. Elaine, like the very best of heroines, has learned to value herself. Evan must earn her trust, her respect, and, if the reader is very very lucky, her love. The story of Elaine and Evan is riveting enough on its own. Ms. Milan adds to it the redemption of Lady Stockhurst&#8217;s reputation as well. The way in which Elaine and her mother are made whole in the eyes of those who have demeaned them for over a decade is so glorious&#8230; really, it&#8217;s just sublime. So, if you have an hour or two and want to immerse yourself in a fiction that inspires, moves, and persuasively entertains, pick up Unlocked. It&#8217;s a rarity: a wallop of a tale neither too long nor too short. It&#8217;s a gift. &nbsp;"

Since her charismatic, troubled older sister Faith committed suicide when Phoebe was ten, Phoebe’s been&nbsp;frozen, unable to move into her future and obsessed with her sister’s past. A chance meeting in Golden Gate Park with one of the hippies in Faith’s&nbsp;group of wild and alluring friends sends Phoebe on a trip to Europe where she hopes to understand&nbsp;who her sister (Faith was eight years older) was and why she took her life. As is true for most coming of age journeys, the self Phoebe comes to know&nbsp;is her own. Ms. Egan prose immerses you in Phoebe, in her thoughts and her emotions. Phoebe travels the places her sister did in the months before her death and the each locale is vividly described, tinctured by Phoebe’s slow understanding of who she is.&nbsp;Halfway through the book, in Munich, Phoebe finds her sister’s old boyfriend, Wolf.&nbsp;The Invisible Circus isn’t a love story, but Phoebe’s and Wolf’s relationship is mesmerizing to read. Readers who expect the modern storytelling Ms. Egan utilized to great effect in The Keep and in Welcome to the Goon Squad will not find that here. Phoebe tells&nbsp;(though the book is not a first person narrative) her story straightforwardly. The Invisible Circus is an elegant novel about love and loss. It remains one of my favorite books."

The ripples from a stone cast into a pond, do they start with the smoothness of the pebble that first attracts the eye, the impulse to feel it against your palm, to make it skip over water&#8230; do they end with the last tiny lap of a wave on the distant shore&#8230;</em></p>\n<p>These are the opening words of <b>The Slow Burn of Silence</b> by Loreth Anne White. Their obliqueness and the craft in the question made me want to read on. I&#8217;m glad I did. From beginning to almost end, <b>Slow Burn of Silence</b> had me flipping the pages, absorbed, wondering what would happen next.</p>\n<p>Rachel Salonen has just lost her sister and brother-in-law to a terrible fire. She has been granted the guardianship of their only child, her niece Quinn. While at the lawyer&#8217;s office to go over the details, Rachel is stunned to learn Quinn&#8217;s birth parents are Jeb Cullen, the love of Rachel&#8217;s life, and Amy Findlay, the woman he was accused of kidnapping, assaulting, and raping nine years ago. Jeb has spent those nine years in prison, put there in part by the testimony of Rachel and others. Amy never really recovered from the violence done to her and, finally, recently committed suicide.</p>\n<p>Rachel is beyond stunned when the lawyer tells her, for the past five years, her sister Sophia has been working with the University of British Columbia’s Innocence Project to get Jeb freed. Jeb has always sworn he is innocent of the crimes against Amy and her still missing friend Merilee. Rachel has never believed him and has never forgiven him for not being the young man she she thought he was when they were in love. Rachel asks the lawyer if Jeb knows Quinn was adopted by her sister; he tells her Jeb was never told where his daughter was placed.</p>\n<p>Six months later, Rachel and Quinn have moved to Snowy River, the small mountain town Rachel grew up in, and into her family&#8217;s old home. It&#8217;s not been easy on either of them. Rachel is running the small town newspaper her father left her last year and trying to raise a clearly distant and angry eight year old girl. Rachel&#8217;s exhausted, sad, and stressed and then, something happens that terrifies her. Her sister&#8217;s work with the Innocence Project has paid off and Jeb Cullen has been released from prison.</p>\n<p>When someone matching Jeb&#8217;s description is seen talking to Quinn on the playground, Rachel is sure he&#8217;s come to do her harm. She heads immediately to the police station and shares her fear with her old friend Adam LeFleur, the Deputy Chief Constable.</p>\n<p><i>“What if he does come back?” I say softly. “Can we stop him from being here?” </i></p>\n<p>“Cullen’s conviction was overturned. He’s as free as the next guy to go wherever he pleases. Law enforcement has no control over his movements. But there is also no reason for him to come back here.”</p>\n<p>“What about that land his mother left him, on the Wolf River?”</p>\n<p>“It’s derelict. There’s nothing there for him. He’d be insane to even try to make something work here. He’s not welcome in Snowy Creek, Rachel, and he knows it. What he did to those girls—people here will crucify him for it if he returns. There’s still so much residual anger, hell knows what might happen if he sets foot in this town. I’m not sure I could control it.”</p>\n<p>“What if it’s revenge he wants? For us testifying? You know, like that felon who comes after his lawyer in that old movie Cape Fear.”</p>\n<p>Adam hesitates. “You’re thinking he might go after your niece to get at you, is that what this is about?

                "text": "When does something begin and end? The ripples from a stone cast into a pond, do they start with the smoothness of the pebble that first attracts the eye, the impulse to feel it against your palm, to make it skip over water&#8230; do they end with the last tiny lap of a wave on the distant shore&#8230; These are the opening words of The Slow Burn of Silence by Loreth Anne White. Their obliqueness and the craft in the question made me want to read on. I&#8217;m glad I did. From beginning to almost end, Slow Burn of Silence had me flipping the pages, absorbed, wondering what would happen next. Rachel Salonen has just lost her sister and brother-in-law to a terrible fire. She has been granted the guardianship of their only child, her niece Quinn. While at the lawyer&#8217;s office to go over the details, Rachel is stunned to learn Quinn&#8217;s birth parents are Jeb Cullen, the love of Rachel&#8217;s life, and Amy Findlay, the woman he was accused of kidnapping, assaulting, and raping nine years ago. Jeb has spent those nine years in prison, put there in part by the testimony of Rachel and others. Amy never really recovered from the violence done to her and, finally, recently committed suicide. Rachel is beyond stunned when the lawyer tells her, for the past five years, her sister Sophia has been working with the University of British Columbia’s Innocence Project to get Jeb freed. Jeb has always sworn he is innocent of the crimes against Amy and her still missing friend Merilee. Rachel has never believed him and has never forgiven him for not being the young man she she thought he was when they were in love. Rachel asks the lawyer if Jeb knows Quinn was adopted by her sister; he tells her Jeb was never told where his daughter was placed. Six months later, Rachel and Quinn have moved to Snowy River, the small mountain town Rachel grew up in, and into her family&#8217;s old home. It&#8217;s not been easy on either of them. Rachel is running the small town newspaper her father left her last year and trying to raise a clearly distant and angry eight year old girl. Rachel&#8217;s exhausted, sad, and stressed and then, something happens that terrifies her. Her sister&#8217;s work with the Innocence Project has paid off and Jeb Cullen has been released from prison. When someone matching Jeb&#8217;s description is seen talking to Quinn on the playground, Rachel is sure he&#8217;s come to do her harm. She heads immediately to the police station and shares her fear with her old friend Adam LeFleur, the Deputy Chief Constable. “What if he does come back?” I say softly. “Can we stop him from being here?” “Cullen’s conviction was overturned. He’s as free as the next guy to go wherever he pleases. Law enforcement has no control over his movements. But there is also no reason for him to come back here.” “What about that land his mother left him, on the Wolf River?” “It’s derelict. There’s nothing there for him. He’d be insane to even try to make something work here. He’s not welcome in Snowy Creek, Rachel, and he knows it. What he did to those girls—people here will crucify him for it if he returns. There’s still so much residual anger, hell knows what might happen if he sets foot in this town. I’m not sure I could control it.” “What if it’s revenge he wants? For us testifying? You know, like that felon who comes after his lawyer in that old movie Cape Fear.” Adam hesitates. “You’re thinking he might go after your niece to get at you, is that what this is about? You think he’ll come after our children, just to mess with our heads?” I bite my lip. Deep down, even now, in spite of what I’ve been led to believe about Jeb, in spite of all the evidence presented in court, in spite of my own fears, in spite of today, I can’t fully accept he’s capable. When it comes to Jeb, I can’t think clearly. Adam is wrong about Jeb, however. Jeb has two very good reasons to return to Snowy River.

Here&#8217;s what she said about the book:</p>\n<blockquote><p>This is a retelling of Beauty and the Beast, or perhaps East of the Sun West of the Moon, set in a world where humans live precariously alongside dangerous fae. The world that Maas has built is anything but Happily Ever After. Feyre’s family is on the brink of starvation and poor when she kills what she thinks is a wolf in the woods. That wolf was actually a fae in disguise, and as retribution, Feyre must go live with the High Lord of the Spring Court. The best reason to read this book is Tamlin, the High Lord. He is everything you want in a sexy leading man.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I love the story of East of the Sun West of the Moon and was intrigued. I like romantic fantasy but rarely read it. (So many books. So little time.) I read the book last week and am glad I did. If I had to pick my favorite thing about the book, however, it wouldn&#8217;t be Tamlin&#8211;more on that later, though.</p>\n<p>Haley, what is it about Tamlin you so love?</p>\n<p><strong>Haley</strong>: I think I liked that he&#8217;s supposed to be the gorgeous, powerful High Lord, but he&#8217;s kind of awkward. He really doesn&#8217;t know how to behave around Feyre when she first comes to stay with him and has to get tips from Lucien. Of course, and not to spoil anything, but I liked the passionate side of him with the whole neck biting scene.</p>\n<p>I have noticed that other reviewers preferred Rhysand. Are you in that camp?</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: &#8220;fans herself&#8221; Who me? Like the bad boy? Never.</p>\n<p>I like Tamlin, I do. From the moment you meet him when he comes to collect Fayre from the human side of Prythian, he&#8217;s a compelling, compassionate hero. And, many of the things that frustrated me about Tamlin in the book made sense by its end. It&#8217;s interesting that in <strong>A</strong> <strong>Court of Thorns and Roses</strong> there are three heroic men: Tamlin, the burdened High Lord, Lucien, the wise-cracking hot headed best friend, and Rhysand, the best looking man in the book who is, in more than one way, Tamlin&#8217;s rival. It&#8217;s unusual to have three male leads and just one female lead in a romance. Do you think Ms. Mass pulled it off?</p>\n<p><strong>Haley</strong>: I do, I think because the three men were all so different. Each was likable and unlikable for their own reasons. Plus, Feyre was tough enough to hold her own with all three of them. Lucien might actually be my favorite of the guys because I enjoyed his banter with Feyre. Rhysand was compelling, but I didn&#8217;t understand some of his behavior, so I couldn&#8217;t totally like him. His taking Feyre to the parties drugged (again, trying hard not to spoil anything) was strange to me, and I never totally understood the purpose for it.<br />\nWhat drew you to Rhysand?</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: Specifically, I&#8217;m drawn to Rhysand as the mate for Feyre, more than I am drawn to her pairing with Tamlin. Tamlin&#8217;s feelings for Fayre were presented as a fait accompli. I didn&#8217;t know why Tamlin cared so for Feyre. But Rhysand&#8217;s interest in Feyre was grounded in very specific things: her looks, her humanness, her strength of will. It&#8217;s kind of like the classic Angel/Spike triangle. I&#8217;m a bigger Spuffy fan than I am a Bangel fan&#8211;although I think the best partner for Buffy was Riley. Rhysand, like Spike, is far more flawed than Tamlin (or Angel). He was more interesting to me.</p>\n<p><strong>Haley</strong>: I can see what you mean. I wonder if in the second book the series we will get to see more of Tamlin&#8217;s flaws. I agree with you about Buffy. Spike was more interesting that Angel. I personally found Angel too melancholy and insufferable.</p>\n<p>Were you at all conflicted by Rhysand&#8217;s treatment of her during the course of her trials?</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: Yes although I think his behavior saved her life. Had he left her alone I think she&#8217;d have been murdered or worse.</p>\n<p><strong>Haley</strong>: So something I found interesting with <strong>A Court of Thorns and Roses</strong> was that it is categorized as Young Adult, but was far more frank about sexuality than YA is typically permitted to be.

Do you think this actually makes it more of a New Adult book (and New Adult Fantasy is something I rarely see)?</p>\n<p><strong> Dabney</strong>: It&nbsp;reminded me of Robin McKinley&#8217;s <strong>Hero and the Crown</strong> in terms of its heat. But given that Fayre&#8217;s 19 and has supported her family for years, I think it has many of the elements we find in a New Adult book. I think the sex in this book is unusual for a romance of any kind in that sex is fairly divorced from love. What did you think about that aspect of the story?</p>\n<p><strong> Haley</strong>: I actually really liked it. It seems to rare to see a story where a woman can sleep with someone before meeting the hero at all, let alone do it without it being something regretful. So often in romance we see these women who, maybe aren&#8217;t virgins, but have gone some period of time without sex before meeting the hero- who of course rocks their world in bed.

It&#8217;s much more like real life.</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: I also think it&#8217;s fascinating that,in some ways, Maas is giving Feyre two lovers to choose between.

The girl in question is Emmy and despite her profound conviction that &#8220;<em>Start fucking your bandmates, and showing up on time for soundcheck is the least of your problems,&#8221;</em> she’s just slept with Travis, her lead guitarist.</p>\n<p>I don’t blame her. Travis is a demi-god in blue jeans and untied Timberlands. He’s sexy and sweet, true to himself and devoted to Emmy. He’s one of the great guys, the kind worth breaking all the rules for. Emmy, though, doesn’t think she can have the band and the boy and for her, the band is the most important thing in her world. As she says, <i></i></p>\n<blockquote><p>I front Stars on the Floor. Locally our nickname is “Soft” because when Billy Broadband, the WRSU DJ (that’s Rutgers college radio, folks), was trying to say “SotF” on air it sounded like “Soft,” and whatever. Close enough. One thing Soft is known for is having its shit together. We’re also a good band, if you like our moody, dark, loud, guitar-driven brand of angst. We pack the local clubs on the weekends, we play Manhattan and Philadelphia on a regular basis, and we play our fair share of out-of-town shows, too. But there are plenty of bands around here doing as well as we are right now. We’re a regular headline at the Court Tavern because we’re not fuckups. I may only be twenty-one, but that matters to me.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The morning after their night of oh so smokin’ sex, Emmy meets Travis for their usual breakfast. <i></i></p>\n<blockquote><p>“What happened last night . . .” I start to say, but I can’t continue because I am choking on the awkward.</p>\n<p>“Was really awesome?” He finishes the sentence for me with a crooked smile and I die. Then he lowers his voice to a whisper again. “I thought so, too.”</p>\n<p>“That’s not what I was going to say.”</p>\n<p>“Really?” he asks in mock surprise. “Because last night you seemed to think it was pretty awesome. That is, if all the orgasms were any indicator.&#8221;</p>\n<p>“&#8230; Travis, I’m serious.”</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry,” he says. “I’m serious, too. Last night really was awesome.”</p>\n<p>“Look, this can’t change anything. We’ve worked too long and too hard to fuck everything up now by this one little moment of weakness, all right?”</p>\n<p>Now he looks serious. Not the serious look he has when he’s trying to nail a difficult solo or when he’s negotiating with the door guy for our fair cut, though. This is more of a pissed-off kind of serious.</p>\n<p>“Sure,” he finally says.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Over the next 200 pages, Ms. Brown explores in temporally brilliant detail what happens when you fall in love with the person you can least afford to fuck things up with. Travis, Emmy, and their bandmates Cole and Joey are fully rendered musicians—I spent much of my mid-twenties hanging out with indie bands and I promise you <i>this is what is like. </i>The road trips, the sound checks, even the drinks on the house are so authentically <em>an indie band in the 1990s </em>that reading this book is an immersive experience, one that I desperately didn&#8217;t want to end.</p>\n<p>There will be readers frustrated by Emmy&#8217;s inability to see that, sometimes, you get the dream and the dreamboat. But Emmy&#8217;s love limiting fears are grounded in something so inherent to her as an artist, as a female artist in a male dominated world, that I had faith she&#8217;d find a way to love and to sing.</p>\n<p><i>&#8220;Stay loud so I don&#8217;t lose you. I will follow the sound of you anywhere.&#8221;</i></p>\n<p>Travis writes these words, but I&#8217;m stealing them, sort of.</p>\n<p>Ms. Brown: Write loud. I will follow your words anywhere.</p>\n",

One thing Soft is known for is having its shit together. We’re also a good band, if you like our moody, dark, loud, guitar-driven brand of angst. We pack the local clubs on the weekends, we play Manhattan and Philadelphia on a regular basis, and we play our fair share of out-of-town shows, too. But there are plenty of bands around here doing as well as we are right now. We’re a regular headline at the Court Tavern because we’re not fuckups. I may only be twenty-one, but that matters to me. The morning after their night of oh so smokin’ sex, Emmy meets Travis for their usual breakfast. “What happened last night . . .” I start to say, but I can’t continue because I am choking on the awkward. “Was really awesome?” He finishes the sentence for me with a crooked smile and I die. Then he lowers his voice to a whisper again. “I thought so, too.” “That’s not what I was going to say.” “Really?” he asks in mock surprise. “Because last night you seemed to think it was pretty awesome. That is, if all the orgasms were any indicator.&#8221; “&#8230; Travis, I’m serious.” “I’m sorry,” he says. “I’m serious, too. Last night really was awesome.” “Look, this can’t change anything. We’ve worked too long and too hard to fuck everything up now by this one little moment of weakness, all right?” Now he looks serious. Not the serious look he has when he’s trying to nail a difficult solo or when he’s negotiating with the door guy for our fair cut, though. This is more of a pissed-off kind of serious. “Sure,” he finally says. Over the next 200 pages, Ms. Brown explores in temporally brilliant detail what happens when you fall in love with the person you can least afford to fuck things up with. Travis, Emmy, and their bandmates Cole and Joey are fully rendered musicians—I spent much of my mid-twenties hanging out with indie bands and I promise you this is what is like. The road trips, the sound checks, even the drinks on the house are so authentically an indie band in the 1990s that reading this book is an immersive experience, one that I desperately didn&#8217;t want to end. There will be readers frustrated by Emmy&#8217;s inability to see that, sometimes, you get the dream and the dreamboat. But Emmy&#8217;s love limiting fears are grounded in something so inherent to her as an artist, as a female artist in a male dominated world, that I had faith she&#8217;d find a way to love and to sing. &#8220;Stay loud so I don&#8217;t lose you. I will follow the sound of you anywhere.&#8221; Travis writes these words, but I&#8217;m stealing them, sort of. Ms. Brown: Write loud. I will follow your words anywhere."

Because even though the air between them becomes so erotically charged that Lyon now understands “<i>why the Romans didn’t feed the lions before they set them upon the Christians. Hunger made one furious and untenable</i>,” he knows that even a stolen kiss would be a declaration. And before he’ll ask Olivia for her hand, he wants first to get his father’s, Isaiah Redmond’s, permission.</p>\n<p>As readers of the series know, Isaiah is not a man who blesses the unions his strong willed sons choose. He banished Miles when Miles fell for the unsuitable Cynthia Brightley. He threatened to disown his youngest son Jonathan. Isaiah’s plans for Lyon do not include a marriage to an Eversea. Isaiah’s intransigence puts Olivia’s and Lyon’s young love to the test and, as a result, Lyon leaves England never to return.</p>\n<p>Until he gets the aforementioned letter.</p>\n<p>I’m not going to share even a whit of what happens after that. I’ll say just that the novel works beautifully on so many levels. Ms. Long has left her readers with many questions over the course of this series. Did Jacob Eversea knowingly invest in slave ships? Is Colin Eversea the result of an illicit love affair between Isaiah Redmond and Isolde Eversea? Why did Olivia agree to marry Landsowne? How did Lyon become Le Chat? This book answers all of these with ingenuity and care.</p>\n<p>Though I’ve not loved every book in the series, I’ve treasured the story of the Everseas and the Redmonds. I’ve reread all of the books at least once and several, I’ve read time and time again. Pennyroyal Green is a world both wondrous and ordinary, peopled with men and women whose lives have entranced me.</p>\n<p>I worried <strong>The Legend of Lyon Redmond</strong> wouldn’t satisfy me. I was wrong. It’s moving, sensual, witty, compelling, startling and a hell of a tale. Lyon’s and Olivia’s love <b>is</b> the stuff of legends and Ms. Long has written them the story they, and we readers, deserve.</p>\n<h3><strong>Buy it at <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2gXve9r\">Amazon</a>/<a href=\"https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/book/the-legend-of-lyon-redmond/id955562734?mt=11&amp;at=1010lmPQ\">Apple Books</a>/<a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8039827/type/dlg/https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-legend-of-lyon-redmond-julie-anne-long/1122681945?ean=9780062334879\">Barnes and Noble</a>/<a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=b95pXvP*dp4&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=361251.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=9310&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Febook%2Fthe-legend-of-lyon-redmond\">Kobo</a></strong></h3>\n",

At the quiet heart of the sparks around them, was a strange peaceful certainty. This person was meant for me. They begin to meet, once a week, for a couple of hours, in secret, by a tree near a home Olivia brings a charity basket to. There they talk. Because even though the air between them becomes so erotically charged that Lyon now understands “why the Romans didn’t feed the lions before they set them upon the Christians. Hunger made one furious and untenable,” he knows that even a stolen kiss would be a declaration. And before he’ll ask Olivia for her hand, he wants first to get his father’s, Isaiah Redmond’s, permission. As readers of the series know, Isaiah is not a man who blesses the unions his strong willed sons choose. He banished Miles when Miles fell for the unsuitable Cynthia Brightley. He threatened to disown his youngest son Jonathan. Isaiah’s plans for Lyon do not include a marriage to an Eversea. Isaiah’s intransigence puts Olivia’s and Lyon’s young love to the test and, as a result, Lyon leaves England never to return. Until he gets the aforementioned letter. I’m not going to share even a whit of what happens after that. I’ll say just that the novel works beautifully on so many levels. Ms. Long has left her readers with many questions over the course of this series. Did Jacob Eversea knowingly invest in slave ships? Is Colin Eversea the result of an illicit love affair between Isaiah Redmond and Isolde Eversea? Why did Olivia agree to marry Landsowne? How did Lyon become Le Chat? This book answers all of these with ingenuity and care. Though I’ve not loved every book in the series, I’ve treasured the story of the Everseas and the Redmonds. I’ve reread all of the books at least once and several, I’ve read time and time again. Pennyroyal Green is a world both wondrous and ordinary, peopled with men and women whose lives have entranced me. I worried The Legend of Lyon Redmond wouldn’t satisfy me. I was wrong. It’s moving, sensual, witty, compelling, startling and a hell of a tale. Lyon’s and Olivia’s love is the stuff of legends and Ms. Long has written them the story they, and we readers, deserve.

There’s almost nothing about it, I didn’t love.</p>\n<p><strong>Caz</strong>:&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/fool-me-twice-by-meredith-duran/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fool Me Twice</a>&nbsp;</strong>was a big hit with me, and I thought&nbsp;<strong>Luck Be a Lady&nbsp;</strong>packed just as much of a punch as that one did, albeit in a different way.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Fool</strong>&nbsp;was edgy and intense, what with the darkness surrounding the hero, whereas this book, while every bit as superb in its storytelling, plotting and characterisation is much more understated.</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: <strong>Luck Be a Lady</strong> isn’t a dark book—except for that one part which we musn’t spoil because it is <em><strong>so</strong></em> wonderful.</p>\n<p><strong>Caz</strong>:&nbsp; The&nbsp;curse of the reviewer&#8217;s&nbsp; lot :( &nbsp;Having to avoid spoilers about the GOOD bits you want to rave about!</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: My husband read it and, I have to say, I think he’s a bit jealous of Nick.</p>\n<p>Nick, oh Nick, he is such a stellar hero.</p>\n<p><strong>Caz</strong>: Nick &#8211; *sigh*.&nbsp; I would be surprised if there was a man alive who wouldn&#8217;t feel just a tad inadequate when compared to Nick! There are a lot of gutter-born heroes in the genre who have dragged themselves up by their bootstraps in order to become wealthy and powerful Robin Hood type figures to the people they grew up amongst. It’s a common trope, but what I liked particularly about Nick is that while he’s certainly had a tough life and has done things he’s not particularly proud of, he isn’t weighed down or haunted by it.&nbsp; He’s not dark and tortured and doesn’t need the heroine to save him from his inner demons.&nbsp; He know who he is and has plenty of real self-confidence rather than bravado, and for the most part he’s content with his lot. It&#8217;s true that Catherine accuses him of cowardice late on in the story, but that&#8217;s because she sees that he has more potential than even he knows, and it’s her way or forcing him to look beyond what he’s accomplished.</p>\n<p>Also – he’s damn hawt. ;)</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: As I was reading<strong> Luck Be a Lady</strong>, I was struck by how masterfully Ms. Duran writes sex scenes. Nick pushes Catherine to allow herself pleasure and yet he does so by,&nbsp;in the best way possible,&nbsp;getting her consent at every turn (or kiss). The love scenes between the two do all I want a love scene to. They’re sensual, they illuminate the relationship between the leads, and they make me feel all melty inside.</p>\n<p><strong>Caz</strong>:&nbsp;It&#8217;s always&nbsp;good to read sex scenes like that, ones that add something to what we know about the characters rather than just feeling as though they&#8217;ve been added in because &#8220;it&#8217;s time.&#8221;&nbsp;Oh &#8211; and&nbsp;the&nbsp;part with the sheet?&nbsp; (I wonder how many readers initially thought the package Catherine insisted on bringing with her was an enticing nightgown or something?!) Her naivete was rather sweet in a way, and fit her character perfectly.&nbsp; It&#8217;s still difficult for women to be taken seriously in some workplaces and for Catherine it would have been even more so.&nbsp; As a business woman, she&#8217;s competing in a man&#8217;s world, and so is in the habit of viewing herself as sexless (to a point).&nbsp; And with that whole episode, she&#8217;s trying to get Nick to see her in the same way, as just a transaction.&nbsp; And I loved the way Nick dealt with the issue; forceful without being overbearing, completely perfect for that moment in their relationship and in very much in character.</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: Yes. That dynamic, where Catherine wants to see everything in her life as a business transaction and Nick is equally determined she see what happens between them as a relationship, is one of the reasons their romance has resonance for me. Catherine has the higher IQ—or at least is far better educated—but Nick has the superior EQ (emotional intelligence). It’s a lovely way to make them equals as lovers.</p>\n<p>I wanted Nick to have a woman who is worthy of him and he does in Catherine. She’s smart, determined, and prickly in wonderful ways.</p>\n<p><strong>Caz</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, so often one reads a book where one comes out at the end liking one protagonist more than the other and feeling as though perhaps they didn&#8217;t quite deserve the other, but that&#8217;s absolutely not what happens here.&nbsp;As Nick&nbsp;can be seen as a&nbsp;tropish hero, so Catherine is a tropish heroine – or could have been in the hands of a lesser author. She’s all about the business (or so she thinks – I love the moment when Nick identifies her drive to succeed as passion!) and actually believes herself to be incapable of anything more.&nbsp; She’s a bit of a puzzle at first though, because she seems to have grown up having a father&nbsp;who&nbsp;doted on her and it’s only later that we come to see how his treatment of her has affected her.&nbsp; I like that she’s strong and confident, but also that she is quick to admit the effect Nick has on her.&nbsp; So often heroines in this sort or situation persist in self-denial when it comes to the way the hero makes her feel, but Catherine doesn’t do that; she refuses to let Nick see it, but knows she’s in trouble almost from the start.</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: And then there’s the story which is complex and rewarding. Part of the joy of reading historical romance is to learn stuff. In this book, Ms. Duran makes the workings of the parish politics and the Water Board intensely interesting. This is a book that argues strongly for the poor and does so in ways that are believable, compelling, and innate to the story.</p>\n<p><strong>Caz</strong>: The thing about the story which makes it stand out so strongly is how utterly plausible the whole thing is. I read a LOT of historicals (as you know) and there is almost always some element that stretches my credibility a bit too much, whether it&#8217;s a virginal heroine suddenly morphing into a sex-kitten, or a miraculous recovery from trauma or whatever; but here there&#8217;s none of that.&nbsp; The whole story is solid and tight-as-a-drum &#8211; so much so that I couldn&#8217;t find a single thing about it that didn&#8217;t ring true (and it&#8217;s a sad fact that sometimes, as reviewers, we DO look for those things rather too often!) &nbsp; Ms Duran&#8217;s research into local politics must have been extensive and the political corruption angle rings&nbsp;entirely&nbsp;true.&nbsp; The asylum plot – also eminently believeable.&nbsp; I couldn’t find a single plot hole or dangling thread in the entire book.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen criticisms of the scene towards the end when Nick &#8211; in order to protect Catherine who is recovering from an injury &#8211; refuses outright to let her go with him and, knowing she will likely follow him, locks her in her room.&nbsp; Personally, I didn&#8217;t find that upsetting; it made sense in the context of the story and of Nick&#8217;s feelings for Catherine.&nbsp; Did it bother you?</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: The asylum plot. <em>So</em> good. It&#8217;s why I read. Just masterful.</p>\n<p>No, Nick&#8217;s actions at the end&nbsp;didn’t bother me. Given what had previously happened to Catherine, I can completely understand Nick’s desire to keep her safe at all costs. That’s one of those things where, if he hadn’t locked her in her room and she’d, again, come to great danger, he’d have lost the thing he loves the most. Ms. Duran makes it clear Nick understands how his actions alienated the woman he loves. I was left believing that he’d never do something like that again… unless he was sure it was necessary for Catherine’s safety.</p>\n<p><strong>Caz</strong>: I&#8217;m glad it wasn&#8217;t just me that saw it that way!</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: After I finished <strong>Luck Be A Lady</strong>, I reread all of Ms. Duran’s books. This book is now my fourth favorite of hers, coming in after (in ascending order) <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/at-your-pleasure-meredith-duran/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>At Your Pleasure</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/bound-by-your-touch-meredith-duran/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Bound by Your Touch</strong></a>, and (tied for first) <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/written-on-your-skin-by-meredith-duran/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Written on Your Skin</strong></a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/the-duke-of-shadows-by-meredith-duran/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>The Duke of Shadows</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>I can’t wait for her next book. You know whose story I’m hoping for next…. (no spoilers, but, oh!)</p>\n<p><strong>Caz</strong>: Heh. I hope this doesn&#8217;t lose me my MD fangirl card, but I actually have a couple of books by her that I haven&#8217;t yet read.&nbsp; In my defence, this is because I hoard them for when I want to read something I KNOW will be awesome and that I will enjoy. <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/written-on-your-skin-by-meredith-duran/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Written on Your Skin</strong></a>&nbsp;is one of those hoarded books. I agree about the others on your list &#8211; <strong>Bound By Your Touch</strong> was the first book of Ms Duran&#8217;s I read and&nbsp;it made me&nbsp;an instant, die-hard fan.</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: So many books, so little time&#8230;. I&#8217;d give <strong>Luck Be a Lady</strong> an A-. What about you?</p>\n<p><strong>Caz</strong>: From me, it gets an A.</p>\n",

I agree about the others on your list &#8211; Bound By Your Touch was the first book of Ms Duran&#8217;s I read and&nbsp;it made me&nbsp;an instant, die-hard fan. Dabney: So many books, so little time&#8230;. I&#8217;d give Luck Be a Lady an A-. What about you? Caz: From me, it gets an A."

The romance genre is, after all, a subset of fiction.</p>\n<p>Kristan Higgins&#8217; latest novel, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/037378497X?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=037378497X&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=allaboutromance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>If You Only Knew</b></a>, is her first foray into women&#8217;s fiction and is not a romance but rather a book about love. In it, two sisters, Rachel, a stay-at-home married mom with triplet three-year old girls and Jenny, a divorced wedding dress designer, must sort out the love in their lives and choose the paths they hope will lead to happiness. Both are lovely and loving and yet don&#8217;t have the lives they&#8217;d hoped for. Jenny is still not over her ex-husband&#8217;s remarriage and new baby even though she tells herself she should be. Rachel has done everything in her power to be a fabulous wife to Adam&#8211;he&#8217;s handsome, a great dad, and an excellent provider&#8211;whom she loves deeply. Then one day, Adam&#8217;s phone pings, Rachel checks it, and, just like that, everything she believes about her marriage begins to crumble.</p>\n<p>The book is written in alternating first person chapters. Jenny and Rachel are close&#8211;Jenny&#8217;s just moved out of Manhattan and into the town they grew up in and in which Rachel and her family still live. Jenny&#8217;s just opened a new shop in the town&#8211;Cambry-on-the Hudson&#8211;and is living in the middle two floors of a four story building. Their father died when they were young and their mom, since his death, has become so pessimistic that, although the sisters love her, they don&#8217;t look to her for support. The sisters are similar&#8211;both white, well-off, educated, and smart. Ms. Higgins manages to make them sound alike in the way that close same sex sisters often do while still giving them very distinct personalities.</p>\n<p>Though <b>If You Only Knew</b> has Ms. Higgins’ trademark humor—the triplets and Leo steal every scene they’re in—each sister&#8217;s story is, in many ways, sad. (Be warned: There are slight spoilers ahead.)</p>\n<p>Jenny married a man she considered her best friend and perfect partner and was devastated when he fell out of love with her, left her, and married a woman who seems to be perfect. She finds herself falling for her sexy neighbor, a piano teacher named Leo, but Leo makes it very clear he&#8217;s uninterested in any sort of intimacy that doesn&#8217;t involve getting naked. Jenny wants to be married and to have children of her own, but, thus far, that life eludes her.</p>\n<p>Rachel&#8217;s life, once upended by a grainy photo of something that initially looks to her to be a knot in a tree, will never again offer the (specific) happy ending she envisioned. Ms. Higgins portrays Rachel&#8217;s anguish beautifully. One of the things that&#8217;s true about real married life, as opposed to that in virtually every romance I&#8217;ve ever read, is that wives don&#8217;t necessary leave husbands who cheat. There are the kids to consider&#8211;and Rachel adores her daughters who in turn adore their dad. There is the possibility that an affair could be a singular event and thus not necessarily something that, on its own merits, is reason enough to break up a family. Ms. Higgins writes Adam with nuance&#8211;he may be in some ways an ass, but he&#8217;s the ass that Rachel loves, married, and has a family with. I loved this about <b>If You Only Knew</b>.</p>\n<p>Each sister is also struggling to make sense of their parents&#8217; marriage. Jenny is sure that her father wasn&#8217;t the perfect husband her mother and sister remember him as&#8211;this makes her furious at her brother-in-law for his poor behavior. Rachel is sure her parents were the perfect couple and that her own troubled marriage reflects poorly on her. Both women are far more angry at the men in their lives than they would like to be. They are, in fact, angrier at life&#8211;and each other&#8211;than makes them comfortable. Ms. Higgins makes their emotional lives rich and resonate.</p>\n<p><b>If You Only Knew</b> is one of my favorite books of the year. I&#8217;m sure that is in part because so much of the sisters&#8217; lives remind me of my own. Like Rachel, I&#8217;ve struggled with infertility, gotten pregnant with multiples (my two youngest are twins), stayed at home with small children, and nurtured (and envied) my spouse&#8217;s successful professional career. The questions Ms. Higgins so deftly explores in <b>If You Only Knew</b> are those I wonder about daily. What does it mean to be loyal to my family? What sort of mother, sister, daughter, friend, and wife do I want to be? What sort am I really?  What are the rules that best govern my heart and my interactions with those I love? My life, just like those of the women in this book, isn&#8217;t gritty&#8211;and I like Rachel and Jenny know how extraordinarily lucky I am&#8211;but it has had its share of pain, doubt, and heartbreaking hurt. Ms. Higgins, in this lovely book, shows something close enough to real life to make her words have heft while still leaving the reader&#8211;as well as Rachel and Jenny&#8211;with enough hope and joy to face the future.</p>\n<h3><strong>Buy it at <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2gdiQ8M\">Amazon</a>/<a href=\"https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/book/if-you-only-knew/id1116591319?mt=11&amp;at=1010lmPQ\">Apple Books</a>/<a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8039827/type/dlg/http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/if-you-only-knew-kristan-higgins/1120421597?ean=9781460398449\">Barnes and Noble</a>/<a href=\"http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=b95pXvP*dp4&amp;subid=&amp;offerid=361251.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=9310&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Febook%2Fif-you-only-knew-14\">Kobo</a></strong></h3>\n",

Today Dabney and Haley discuss the novel.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Haley</strong>: So, Dabney, I&#8217;m excited to discuss this book because Sarah Morgan has become an author to watch, for me. I really enjoyed the first two books of the <strong><em>O&#8217;Neil Brothers</em></strong> series and couldn&#8217;t wait to see how things panned out between Brenna and Tyler.

If the suspense is fabulous, the romance is often unbelievable.</p>\n<p>But those of us who like romantic suspense got lucky in 2013. Carolyn Crane published two books in her <b><i>The Associates</i></b> series. The first of these, <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/against-the-dark-by-carolyn-crane/\"><b>Against the Dark</b></a>, is a very good book. The second, <b>Off the Edge</b>, is even better.</p>\n<p>Peter McMillan was, in an earlier life, a brilliant scholar of linguistics. His life was shattered ten years ago when a bomb on a train blew up everyone he loved. Now he&#8217;s a covert agent who works for the Association, a ruthless, shadowy, vigilante organization dedicated to, as its leader Dax says, &#8220;keeping the balance of power intact. Keeping World War III from happening. And stopping the most despicable crimes.&#8221; Peter, in addition to being a stone cold killer, is a hunter. And his choice of weapon is language.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Nobody escaped Macmillan. Back when he had been a rising star in the linguistics world, he could spend entire months studying the way different people pronounced a diphthong like the ow in low, and draw all kinds of conclusions about what that meant. He could see a universe in a single word choice. He used his expertise to understand people, and by extension, humanity itself.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Peter is in Bangkok, along with representatives from every evil corner of the world. They&#8217;ve all gathered because a weapon, a weapon which will give its owner the ability to rule the world, is being put up for auction by the criminal Jazzman. The Associates are there to make sure the good guys get the weapon. The problem is no one knows who Jazzman is. Peter, however, has studied everything the Association has on Jazzman, and will be able to identify him if he can hear him speak.</p>\n<p>Jazzman is indeed coming to Bangkok to auction off the weapon, the TZ – 5. He is also coming to capture his ex-wife, a woman who turned him over to the law and then ran. This woman, Laney Lancaster, has been hiding out in Bangkok for the past two years, living in the Bangkok Imperiale Hotel Des Roses, owned by a family of Thai criminals, where she thinks she is safe. Laney too loves words; she&#8217;s a singer songwriter who performs nightly at the hotel. Unfortunately for Laney Jazzman has chosen the Hotel Des Roses as the place to hold his iniquitous auction.</p>\n<p>Peter is drawn to Laney from the moment he hears her sing. That&#8217;s not why he seduces her, however. He beds her in order to steal her recording of the night&#8217;s show from her laptop. He thinks there&#8217;s a good chance that if he listens to all the voices of those watching her show – almost all of whom are there for the TZ – 5 auction – he&#8217;ll be able to figure out who Jazzman is.</p>\n<p>Ms. Crane takes this very suspenseful set up and imbues it with enough adrenaline to keep readers eagerly and anxiously flipping the pages. Within a few chapters, seemingly everyone is after Laney and Peter as they wend their way through the back alleys of Bangkok. It seems impossible Laney will be able to escape her heinous troll of a husband, the Associates will be able to get their hands on the TZ–5, or Peter will survive to live another day let alone find a way to live happily ever after. Just as in the <b><i>Ice</i></b> series, it&#8217;s unclear whom Laney can trust and whom Peter can rely on. The two are forced to work together in order to survive and together they make a damn good team and a surpassingly sexy couple.</p>\n<p>There are so many great things about this book. The plot is excellent, the suspense riveting, the location palpable, the secondary characters stark and interesting, and the writing brilliant. Peter and Laney have incredible chemistry, physical and verbal.

In Laura Lee Guhrke’s <b>When the Marquess Met His Match</b>, the lovers <b><i>are</i></b> a social climber and a fortune hunter.</p>\n<p>The social climber is Lady Belinda Featherstone. Belinda, years ago, married an Earl with whom she was madly in love. He was not and made it clear he married her for her piles of American money. When he died, five years ago — he had a heart attack while in bed with his current mistress — he’d spent every last cent of her dowry. Since then Belinda has made a career for herself as the premier matchmaker for the ton.

His control freak of the father, the cold and arrogant Duke of Landsdowne, has cut off his allowance and will only reinstate his income if Nicholas marries a woman of his father’s choosing. Nicholas and his father loathe each other. The former has spent his entire adult life acting in ways he knows will infuriate the latter. Now thirty and accustomed to years of independence, Nicholas has no intention of doing his father’s bidding.

She initially refuses to help him. She sees him as a feckless rake who will do nothing but break the heart of any young woman he weds. Nicholas maneuvers her into helping him despite her low opinion. For his part, from the moment he steps into her parlor, he is drawn to her. She’d be the perfect wife for him: A woman he wants to bed whose nationality and class would infuriate his father, if only she were wealthy.</p>\n<p>I enjoyed <b>When the Marquess Met His Match</b>. Ms. Guhrke writes her opposites attract tale well and believably. Nicholas isn’t the contemptible character Belinda believes him to be but he is careless and easily irresponsible. For him to become a man worthy of his own and Belinda’s respect he must reshape his life into one with purpose. Belinda too must change. She must become vulnerable and able to risk love. Ms. Guhrke lets both of them evolve at a pace and in a way that seems viable.</p>\n<p>The romance between Nicholas and Belinda is less convincing. They suffer from insta–lust and move too quickly into passionate kisses and waves of unfulfilled desire. This sexual focus is more believable for Nicholas who has had many a lover. It works less well for Belinda who has only ever made love with her husband, an experience she found uninspiring. However, Ms. Guhrke writes such witty banter and such sultry love scenes that this flaw is easy to ignore.</p>\n<p>This is a book focused on its two protagonists. There are few secondary characters of note — only the Duke of Landsdowne and Belinda’s unconventionally married friend, the Duchess of Margrave, stand out. The novel is at its best in its first and last thirds; the middle third seems unnecessarily long.</p>\n<p>Though <b>When the Marquess Met His Match </b> won’t replace <b>Guilty Pleasures </b> as my favorite of Ms. Guhrke’s works, it is an engaging addition to her canon.</p>\n<h3>Buy it on <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2H6ygsj\">Amazon</a>/<a href=\"https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/book/when-the-marquess-met-his-match/id508196473?mt=11&amp;at=1010lmPQ\">Apple Books</a>/<a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8039827/type/dlg/http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/when-the-marquess-met-his-match-laura-lee-guhrke/1114308376?ean=9780062118189\">Barnes &amp; Noble</a>/<a href=\"http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=b95pXvP*dp4&amp;subid=&amp;offerid=361251.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=9310&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.kobobooks.com%2Fen-us%2Febook%2Fwhen-the-marquess-met-his-match\">Kobo</a></h3>\n",

                "html": "<p><strong>Wendy Clyde</strong> here. Dabney Grinnan and I are discussing R. Lee Smith’s <b>The Last Hour of Gann</b>, which was released in September.</p>\n<p>While Dabney had read Ms. Smith, this is my first book by her and I was very pleasantly surprised by the book’s quality and complexity. When Dabney suggested we have a Pandora’s Box discussion I leapt at the chance, because <b>The Last Hour of Gann</b> is a thought-provoking, emotional book that stays with you long after you’ve finished reading. It’s difficult to provide a brief synopsis for such an epic book, but the basic premise is the story of an earth woman, Amber Bierce, who, seeking to leave her bleak life on Earth behind, signs on for interplanetary colonization, dragging her reluctant sister along. Their ship crashes on an alien planet with thousands of human lives lost. Chances for the few survivors to flourish are slim to none until the party meets with an indigenous lizard-man, the warrior-priest Uyane Meoraq. Meoraq is on a religious pilgrimage when he encounters the flat-faced, soft-skinned humans. Deciding that there are lessons to be learned from this alien species he agrees to help them survive and allows them to travel with him to the temple he’s seeking. He finds Amber the most intriguing of all the humans and the two soon develop a friendship that deepens into attraction.</p>\n<p><strong>Wendy</strong>: Dabney, I adored this book. Never having read Smith before I had no idea that I was in for a marathon of nonstop reading while my home went to hell all around me. Having more experience with Smith’s books, was it what you were expecting? Did you like it?</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: I did. And as for what I was expecting, I’d have to say that one of the cool things about Ms. Smith’s work is that each book is wildly different. They all are sci-fi erotica/romance, but the plot and characters in each are distinctly different. In <b>Heat</b>, another book by Ms. Smith I like, the setting is Earth, there are just two aliens, and there are two compelling love stories. <b>Heat</b> is gripping because it’s a thriller, with one alien working against the clock to stop the other. That sense of urgency is missing in <b>The Last Hour of Gann</b> but the latter is just as interesting.</p>\n<p><strong>Wendy</strong>: This book was certainly different from any of the other romances I’ve read. Inter-species love has been explored before, of course, but never so successfully and somehow realistically, in my opinion. That the main characters were different species seemed not as much a means of titillating readers as it was a natural progression of a fantastic, sexy, romance.</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: I have to say, other than <b>Heat</b>, I’ve don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve read another alien/human love story. I read hardly any paranormal romance. What intrigues me about the world Ms. Lee creates in is the way she uses an alien culture as a measure of our own. The world of Gann is one in which men have all the power, sex is either a means of violence or a means of procreation, and religious mandates are the law. As I read the novel, I kept comparing and contrasting the planet of Gann&#8211;Ms. Smith’s world-building is so detailed and believable&#8211;to our own. It’s a book that made me think.</p>\n<p><strong>Wendy</strong>: She does hold a mirror up to our world! It also incorporates environmental issues, religious beliefs, societal pressures, and other heavy topics such as the result of inter-global war. And yes, it made me think, and keep thinking. I couldn’t decide if it was a cautionary tale or some sort of funny, erotic, pseudo-inspirational (just writing that makes me grin). There are so many things I want to talk about! What aspect of the book affected you the most deeply?</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: One of the most perplexing things of living in modern society is trying to judge – and boy is that a loaded word – the culture and customs of others. In<b> The Last Hour of Gann,</b> the mores of that planet allow for behaviors that, were they on Earth, would be morally abhorrent. The most striking example of this is the sex Meoraq is allowed/expected to have with the women in each city he comes to as a high priest. The women have no say in this. They literally bend over and are taken by Meoraq after he wins the battles that serve as trials on Gann. In our culture we would call that rape. But Gann is not Earth and Meoraq is not, in the context of his world, a villain. In that context, his behavior is exemplary. In <b>The Last Hour of Gann</b>, that planet’s past actions were so destructive that the civilization that sprung up in their wake is a rigid and unforgiving one. It’s a culture I’d loathe to live in. And yet clearly the ruinous choices those on Gann made long ago are echoed in choices we are making today. I have to admit I’ve rarely read erotic romance that made me think so hard about the sociology of civilizations.</p>\n<p><strong>Wendy</strong>: Yes, I kept comparing Gann’s history to our current civilization and to the world that Amber left behind, our future. It all seemed so bleak. So what kind of genius does Smith have that in the midst of all the misadventure and strife she also demonstrated a great sense of humor? Meoraq made me laugh so many times. The way he would pray for patience, and ask his god why he couldn’t be a dick without his god catching him at it was just priceless. Did you also find him funny? Amber was amusing too, and I felt that the fact they both shared a dry sense of humor and the ability to laugh at their troubles added a wonderful flavor to their romance.</p>\n<p><strong>Dabney</strong>: Yes. This book has it all: rollicking humor, hot sex, grave danger, weighty ideas, and characters that are believable and sympathetic. Meoraq is a great hero; even as he is a warrior and a lizard-man of decisive action he is constantly thinking, questioning himself and his religion, and challenging himself to do the right thing. Furthermore he is funny. His relationship with Amber was wonderful in part because he, the alien, enables her to be the fabulous person she is. When we first meet Amber, she’s strong but lacking in empathy. On Earth, the society she lived in was so hellish that all she could do was get out of there. On Gann, despite the horrific things she and the other humans experience, Amber becomes every bit as heroic as Meoraq. I loved them as a couple.</p>\n<p><strong>Wendy</strong>: Oh absolutely!

                "text": "Wendy Clyde here. Dabney Grinnan and I are discussing R. Lee Smith’s The Last Hour of Gann, which was released in September. While Dabney had read Ms. Smith, this is my first book by her and I was very pleasantly surprised by the book’s quality and complexity. When Dabney suggested we have a Pandora’s Box discussion I leapt at the chance, because The Last Hour of Gann is a thought-provoking, emotional book that stays with you long after you’ve finished reading. It’s difficult to provide a brief synopsis for such an epic book, but the basic premise is the story of an earth woman, Amber Bierce, who, seeking to leave her bleak life on Earth behind, signs on for interplanetary colonization, dragging her reluctant sister along. Their ship crashes on an alien planet with thousands of human lives lost. Chances for the few survivors to flourish are slim to none until the party meets with an indigenous lizard-man, the warrior-priest Uyane Meoraq. Meoraq is on a religious pilgrimage when he encounters the flat-faced, soft-skinned humans. Deciding that there are lessons to be learned from this alien species he agrees to help them survive and allows them to travel with him to the temple he’s seeking. He finds Amber the most intriguing of all the humans and the two soon develop a friendship that deepens into attraction. Wendy: Dabney, I adored this book. Never having read Smith before I had no idea that I was in for a marathon of nonstop reading while my home went to hell all around me. Having more experience with Smith’s books, was it what you were expecting? Did you like it? Dabney: I did. And as for what I was expecting, I’d have to say that one of the cool things about Ms. Smith’s work is that each book is wildly different. They all are sci-fi erotica/romance, but the plot and characters in each are distinctly different. In Heat, another book by Ms. Smith I like, the setting is Earth, there are just two aliens, and there are two compelling love stories. Heat is gripping because it’s a thriller, with one alien working against the clock to stop the other. That sense of urgency is missing in The Last Hour of Gann but the latter is just as interesting. Wendy: This book was certainly different from any of the other romances I’ve read. Inter-species love has been explored before, of course, but never so successfully and somehow realistically, in my opinion. That the main characters were different species seemed not as much a means of titillating readers as it was a natural progression of a fantastic, sexy, romance. Dabney: I have to say, other than Heat, I’ve don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve read another alien/human love story. I read hardly any paranormal romance. What intrigues me about the world Ms. Lee creates in is the way she uses an alien culture as a measure of our own. The world of Gann is one in which men have all the power, sex is either a means of violence or a means of procreation, and religious mandates are the law. As I read the novel, I kept comparing and contrasting the planet of Gann&#8211;Ms. Smith’s world-building is so detailed and believable&#8211;to our own. It’s a book that made me think. Wendy: She does hold a mirror up to our world! It also incorporates environmental issues, religious beliefs, societal pressures, and other heavy topics such as the result of inter-global war. And yes, it made me think, and keep thinking. I couldn’t decide if it was a cautionary tale or some sort of funny, erotic, pseudo-inspirational (just writing that makes me grin). There are so many things I want to talk about! What aspect of the book affected you the most deeply? Dabney: One of the most perplexing things of living in modern society is trying to judge – and boy is that a loaded word – the culture and customs of others. In The Last Hour of Gann, the mores of that planet allow for behaviors that, were they on Earth, would be morally abhorrent. The most striking example of this is the sex Meoraq is allowed/expected to have with the women in each city he comes to as a high priest. The women have no say in this. They literally bend over and are taken by Meoraq after he wins the battles that serve as trials on Gann. In our culture we would call that rape. But Gann is not Earth and Meoraq is not, in the context of his world, a villain. In that context, his behavior is exemplary. In The Last Hour of Gann, that planet’s past actions were so destructive that the civilization that sprung up in their wake is a rigid and unforgiving one. It’s a culture I’d loathe to live in. And yet clearly the ruinous choices those on Gann made long ago are echoed in choices we are making today. I have to admit I’ve rarely read erotic romance that made me think so hard about the sociology of civilizations. Wendy: Yes, I kept comparing Gann’s history to our current civilization and to the world that Amber left behind, our future. It all seemed so bleak. So what kind of genius does Smith have that in the midst of all the misadventure and strife she also demonstrated a great sense of humor? Meoraq made me laugh so many times. The way he would pray for patience, and ask his god why he couldn’t be a dick without his god catching him at it was just priceless. Did you also find him funny? Amber was amusing too, and I felt that the fact they both shared a dry sense of humor and the ability to laugh at their troubles added a wonderful flavor to their romance. Dabney: Yes. This book has it all: rollicking humor, hot sex, grave danger, weighty ideas, and characters that are believable and sympathetic. Meoraq is a great hero; even as he is a warrior and a lizard-man of decisive action he is constantly thinking, questioning himself and his religion, and challenging himself to do the right thing. Furthermore he is funny. His relationship with Amber was wonderful in part because he, the alien, enables her to be the fabulous person she is. When we first meet Amber, she’s strong but lacking in empathy. On Earth, the society she lived in was so hellish that all she could do was get out of there. On Gann, despite the horrific things she and the other humans experience, Amber becomes every bit as heroic as Meoraq. I loved them as a couple. Wendy: Oh absolutely! They’re the best couple of 2013 for me. I thought at first that the sex-with-an-alien thing would be off-putting, but in that regard their species became unimportant and it was all about the chemistry, which they had by the truckload. That portion of the book where Meoraq and Amber were in the wilderness alone was just wonderful, wasn’t it? But then, how did you feel about the violence and treachery and rape that followed? I normally skim through all that stuff because it feels gratuitous most of the time, but here it felt like a natural progression of events &#8211; necessary for the ending to work.

                "html": "<p><b>It Happened One Midnight</b> is the eighth book in Ms. Long&#8217;s <i><b>Pennyroyal Green</b></i> series. The hero is Jonathan Redmond, the youngest of the Redmonds.This fact alone made me consider downgrading this book. I and the rest of Ms. Long&#8217;s fans have been impatiently waiting since <b>I Kissed an Earl</b> (#5) to learn what Lyon is doing and when Olivia will find out the truth about her father&#8217;s involvement in the slave trade. Sadly, there is so little information in this book about the Eversea/Redmond storyline <b>It Happened One Midnight</b> could be read as a stand-alone book.</p>\n<p><b>It Happened One Midnight</b> takes place nine months after the end of <b>I Kissed an Earl</b>. As it begins, Jonathan Redmond encounters Thomasina de Ballesteros (she goes by Tommy) standing outside the window of the Duke of Greyfolk&#8217;s London home gazing fixedly at the elderly Duke inside. Jonathan is leaving the Duke&#8217;s after dinner there; he wrangled an invitation to try to convince the Duke to invest in a color printing press Jonathan is an owner of. Jonathan has no idea why Tommy, the current toast of the demimonde, is loitering in the dark. He and Tommy had met earlier in the day at a salon Tommy hosts for the eccentric, elderly Countess Mirabeau and had taken each other&#8217;s measure. Both are exceptionally gorgeous and charming. On the surface, both are clichés. Jonathan is an aristocratic rake; Tommy, a poor beauty who plans to trade her body for wealth and security. Beneath the selves they show to society, however, their characters are more complex.</p>\n<p>Jonathan and Tommy verbally spar in the moonlight. At the end of their conversation, they part, aware that while neither is an appropriate romantic partner for the other, they like each other and might, perhaps, be able to be friends.</p>\n<p>The next day, Jonathan returns to the Redmond home in Pennyroyal Green. He comes to visit his very pregnant sister Violet, and having failed to enlist the financial support of Greyfolk, to ask his father, Isaiah, for financial backing for his new business. Isaiah, however, makes it clear to Jonathan that he, Isaiah, hasn&#8217;t a whit of faith in Jonathan&#8217;s ability to do anything but look good and get in trouble.</p>\n<p>Jonathan is shocked his father thinks so little of him. He&#8217;s then genuinely infuriated when his father tells him Jonathan has six months to marry a woman Isaiah approves of or Jonathan will be completely cut off financially. This exchange between father and son is reminiscent of Isaiah&#8217;s similar threat to Jonathan&#8217;s older brother Miles (the hero of <b>Like No Other Lover</b>) which Miles flouted by marrying a woman very much like Tommy.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s clear to the reader that, like Miles, Jonathan isn&#8217;t going to let his father dictate the woman he&#8217;ll marry. And, given that Tommy is the heroine of the book, it&#8217;s also clear this book shares a theme that permeates many of the <b><i>Pennyroyal Green</i></b> books. In all but two of the eight books, a man is paired with a woman society deems unacceptable as his bride. Ms. Long writes about class distinctions well, yet reading this story again &#8211; told better in <b>How the Marquess Was Won</b> &#8211; makes <b>It Happened One Midnight</b> feel somewhat stale.</p>\n<p>Tommy is an inappropriate woman for Jonathan. She&#8217;s the illegitimate and unrecognized daughter of a Duke (guess which one?) and his long dead mistress. Her mother died when she was a child, and prior to the intervention of Countess Mirabeau, Tommy fared poorly on the London streets. She&#8217;s clever, manipulative, and ambitious. She longs for a family of her own and to feel owned by a family as well. She flirts with what seems like every unmarried aristocrat in London, but gives herself to none of them, as she is holding out for marriage. She&#8217;s also a do-gooder of dangerous proportions: She steals/rescues abused child servants and finds a safe place for them to develop a trade. This aspect of her personality makes her admirable almost to the point of perfection. She&#8217;s the Clark Kent of scandalous salons: A seemingly shallow temptress in the evening and a reckless savior of the weak at midnight.</p>\n<p>Tommy pulls Jonathan into her midnight missions and he, in turn, uses money she gives him (garnered by pawning a necklace of perfect pearls from an admirer) to fund the first runs of his new color printing press. A suggestion from Tommy about what the printing press could print and make a mint off of gives Jonathan a brilliant idea that earns him financial independence and his father&#8217;s fury.</p>\n<p>The plot is an odd meld of commerce, danger, adorable tots, explosive kisses, and self-determination. Ms. Long pulls it off although the most compelling story is not of that era&#8217;s abused impoverished young but rather of Jonathan&#8217;s strategic toppling of his father&#8217;s limiting demands. Isaiah Redmond has long been cruising for a comeuppance and it&#8217;s satisfying to see his youngest son deliver it to him.</p>\n<p>I liked Jonathan more than Tommy in part because Jonathan is deftly and deeply portrayed. Readers of the series have gotten to know him and his troubled family over many pages and he is a compelling and confident hero. Tommy is much hazier. Whole parts of her are missing (her sexual and relational past, her relationship with her mother, how she acquired her many skills, just to name a few). And unlike, Jonathan, she doesn&#8217;t have to give up anything to fuse her future with his.</p>\n<p>I did enjoy the interactions between the two. Ms. Long excels at writing witty repartee and deliciously effective love scenes. One of the pleasant aspects of <b>It Happened One Midnight</b> is that Tommy and Jonathan like each other long before they begin exploring the lust they feel. I worried, once they became lovers, that Jonathan conflated lust and love, but by the (sigh) epilogue, he and Tommy have the stuff that dreams are made of: True, lasting, passionate love.</p>\n<p>I count Ms. Long as one of my favorite writers. Two of her <b><i>Pennyroyal </i></b>books (#4 and #5) are among my top ten favorite historical romances. <b>It Happened One Midnight</b> is not one of Ms. Long&#8217;s best books, but nor is it a bad one. It&#8217;s good, not great.</p>\n<p>Did I like it less because I&#8217;m running out of patience with the <b><i>Pennyroyal</i></b> series? I don&#8217;t think so. There are things in this book besides its lack of Olivia/Lyon that didn&#8217;t work for me. After reading it twice, I decided to give it a B. I am, however, steeling myself for book nine. It&#8217;s not about Olivia and Lyon either. It&#8217;s Ian Eversea&#8217;s story (last seen being terrorized by the fabulous Duke of Falconbridge, the hero of <b>What I Did for a Duke</b>) and is due out next March. <b><i>Pennyroyal Green</i></b> fans will line up in droves to read it and, yes, I&#8217;ll be right there with them.</p>\n",

Jonathan has no idea why Tommy, the current toast of the demimonde, is loitering in the dark. He and Tommy had met earlier in the day at a salon Tommy hosts for the eccentric, elderly Countess Mirabeau and had taken each other&#8217;s measure. Both are exceptionally gorgeous and charming. On the surface, both are clichés. Jonathan is an aristocratic rake; Tommy, a poor beauty who plans to trade her body for wealth and security. Beneath the selves they show to society, however, their characters are more complex. Jonathan and Tommy verbally spar in the moonlight. At the end of their conversation, they part, aware that while neither is an appropriate romantic partner for the other, they like each other and might, perhaps, be able to be friends. The next day, Jonathan returns to the Redmond home in Pennyroyal Green. He comes to visit his very pregnant sister Violet, and having failed to enlist the financial support of Greyfolk, to ask his father, Isaiah, for financial backing for his new business. Isaiah, however, makes it clear to Jonathan that he, Isaiah, hasn&#8217;t a whit of faith in Jonathan&#8217;s ability to do anything but look good and get in trouble. Jonathan is shocked his father thinks so little of him. He&#8217;s then genuinely infuriated when his father tells him Jonathan has six months to marry a woman Isaiah approves of or Jonathan will be completely cut off financially. This exchange between father and son is reminiscent of Isaiah&#8217;s similar threat to Jonathan&#8217;s older brother Miles (the hero of Like No Other Lover) which Miles flouted by marrying a woman very much like Tommy. It&#8217;s clear to the reader that, like Miles, Jonathan isn&#8217;t going to let his father dictate the woman he&#8217;ll marry. And, given that Tommy is the heroine of the book, it&#8217;s also clear this book shares a theme that permeates many of the Pennyroyal Green books. In all but two of the eight books, a man is paired with a woman society deems unacceptable as his bride. Ms. Long writes about class distinctions well, yet reading this story again &#8211; told better in How the Marquess Was Won &#8211; makes It Happened One Midnight feel somewhat stale. Tommy is an inappropriate woman for Jonathan. She&#8217;s the illegitimate and unrecognized daughter of a Duke (guess which one?) and his long dead mistress. Her mother died when she was a child, and prior to the intervention of Countess Mirabeau, Tommy fared poorly on the London streets. She&#8217;s clever, manipulative, and ambitious. She longs for a family of her own and to feel owned by a family as well. She flirts with what seems like every unmarried aristocrat in London, but gives herself to none of them, as she is holding out for marriage. She&#8217;s also a do-gooder of dangerous proportions: She steals/rescues abused child servants and finds a safe place for them to develop a trade. This aspect of her personality makes her admirable almost to the point of perfection. She&#8217;s the Clark Kent of scandalous salons: A seemingly shallow temptress in the evening and a reckless savior of the weak at midnight. Tommy pulls Jonathan into her midnight missions and he, in turn, uses money she gives him (garnered by pawning a necklace of perfect pearls from an admirer) to fund the first runs of his new color printing press. A suggestion from Tommy about what the printing press could print and make a mint off of gives Jonathan a brilliant idea that earns him financial independence and his father&#8217;s fury. The plot is an odd meld of commerce, danger, adorable tots, explosive kisses, and self-determination. Ms. Long pulls it off although the most compelling story is not of that era&#8217;s abused impoverished young but rather of Jonathan&#8217;s strategic toppling of his father&#8217;s limiting demands. Isaiah Redmond has long been cruising for a comeuppance and it&#8217;s satisfying to see his youngest son deliver it to him. I liked Jonathan more than Tommy in part because Jonathan is deftly and deeply portrayed. Readers of the series have gotten to know him and his troubled family over many pages and he is a compelling and confident hero. Tommy is much hazier. Whole parts of her are missing (her sexual and relational past, her relationship with her mother, how she acquired her many skills, just to name a few). And unlike, Jonathan, she doesn&#8217;t have to give up anything to fuse her future with his. I did enjoy the interactions between the two. Ms. Long excels at writing witty repartee and deliciously effective love scenes. One of the pleasant aspects of It Happened One Midnight is that Tommy and Jonathan like each other long before they begin exploring the lust they feel. I worried, once they became lovers, that Jonathan conflated lust and love, but by the (sigh) epilogue, he and Tommy have the stuff that dreams are made of: True, lasting, passionate love. I count Ms. Long as one of my favorite writers. Two of her Pennyroyal books (#4 and #5) are among my top ten favorite historical romances. It Happened One Midnight is not one of Ms. Long&#8217;s best books, but nor is it a bad one. It&#8217;s good, not great. Did I like it less because I&#8217;m running out of patience with the Pennyroyal series? I don&#8217;t think so. There are things in this book besides its lack of Olivia/Lyon that didn&#8217;t work for me. After reading it twice, I decided to give it a B. I am, however, steeling myself for book nine. It&#8217;s not about Olivia and Lyon either. It&#8217;s Ian Eversea&#8217;s story (last seen being terrorized by the fabulous Duke of Falconbridge, the hero of What I Did for a Duke) and is due out next March. Pennyroyal Green fans will line up in droves to read it and, yes, I&#8217;ll be right there with them."

This book, <b>Taste for Trouble</b>, is set in the suburbs of DC, has a scheming Martha Stewart wannabe, and a professional soccer playing sorta hot Southern gentleman for a hero. I loved <b>Money Shot</b>; I like <b>Taste for Trouble</b>.</p>\n<p><b>Taste for Trouble</b> opens with the familiar scene of a perfectionist female getting left at the altar by her &#8220;I&#8217;ve fallen in love with your assistant&#8221; fiance. The dumpee is Belinda West, a driven woman who is the second in command on &#8220;Kate Every Day,&#8221; a popular syndicated daytime TV show. Belinda is upset about her jilting, but not because she loves her jilter. He is just a good friend who, until he fell for another woman, had agreed with Belinda that <i>“Love is nothing more than an excuse to be fickle, impulsive and selfish. People shouldn’t build a lunch date around it, let alone a marriage.&#8221;</i> Belinda is, however, dismayed that the entire world, as well as Kate of &#8220;Kate Every Day&#8221;, has just watched Belinda&#8217;s non-wedding on national TV. Kate, who is poised to pick her successor &#8211; Belinda was sure it would be her &#8211; tells Belinda she&#8217;s clearly not up to &#8220;Kate Every Day&#8221; standards and fires her.</p>\n<p>Belinda and Kate&#8217;s agent, a truly lovely man named Bob Beck, tells Belinda she can win her job back if she takes agrees to a (ludicrous) scheme Bob and Kate have cooked up. Another of Bob&#8217;s clients, the man-child soccer star James Blake, is in need of a manners nanny. James is in danger of being kicked off the DC Statesmen because, as Bob says, &#8220;He drinks, he fights, and if he’s ever had a date he didn’t pick up in a strip club I’ve never met her.” Bob proposes that Belinda spend the four weeks supervising James and his two brothers, Will and Drew. When Belinda asks for clarification, Bob explains.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It means that each week for the next four weeks, Kate will assign you a new social grace to teach our boy.

It seems forced, silly, and unbelievable. I doubted Ms. Sey, though her <i>Money</i> books are excellently plotted, could make this work. I was wrong.

In fact, my favorite part of the book is how bitter and angry Will (my favorite character as well), James&#8217;s older brother, is about the ties that bind him to his brothers. Will is one unhappy man. He&#8217;s a borderline alcoholic with a compulsive need to lash out and destroy. He is furious at the ease with which James gets everything: success, money, women, friends, and love. He tears down Drew&#8217;s simple joy in everyday life every chance he gets. He hates who he is but he can&#8217;t stop himself from being so self-destructive. Yet it clear he loves his brothers deeply and their love for him exists whether or not he&#8217;s an utter ass.

Their bonded life exists in sharp contrast to Belinda&#8217;s (and her boss Kate&#8217;s) very isolated one. This difference in life experience shapes how differently Belinda and James see their attraction to each other. Belinda fights it because not only is love a messy business, James is her job. Belinda has made her life work by living by a series of rules and one of those is that it is unprofessional to get involved with client. This distinction means nothing to James. He begins falling for Belinda from the moment he meets her. Soon, he cares deeply for her and, for James, that connection is all that matters. Their relationship is winning without being sappy, sexy without being overheated.</p>\n<p>At times, this book felt like a Desert Island Keeper to me. In other places, it felt like an inchoate mess. But even when a plot-line didn&#8217;t work or a character behaved incomprehensibly, I wanted to keep reading. This is a read that, in places, made my heart hurt. I cried at the end, the kind of tears that make you want to find those you love and hold them in your arms. I connected with the Blakes and Belinda, with Kate &#8211; poor, bitchy Kate &#8211; and Bob, and with Audrey (Will&#8217;s love interest) and her little girl. I wanted all of these characters to find happiness. Not all do and that too makes this a stronger book than its plot would suggest. I&#8217;m glad I read it.

The rest of the book, however, does not live up to the promise of the first twenty-one pages.</p>\n<p>The book opens with Joy Hightower, a rather private young woman who teaches art to gifted high school students, walking on to the movie set of an upcoming blockbuster fantasy film, <i>Maritime</i>. She&#8217;s come at the call of her uncle Seth who heads the makeup department. He&#8217;s understaffed and needs Joy, a talented makeup artist in her own right, to finish a tattoo for him. Joy listens to his request in a bit of a daze. She&#8217;s just come from a doctor&#8217;s appointment where she&#8217;s been told she has metastatic B-cell lymphoma. Joy agrees to help out and finds herself painting on the torso of a gorgeous creature &#8211; the top half of his face is completely covered by a mask and more makeup. The man&#8217;s body is stunning, and as Joy begins to paint his abdomen, she becomes aroused. He, only wearing very minimal stretchy briefs, does too. The atmosphere between the two of them becomes saturated with desire and by the time she finishes the tattoo, Joy longs to touch him intimately. She does &#8211; with his permission; she doesn&#8217;t know his name &#8211; and the two share the most erotic experience of their lives. They agree to meet at the end of the shoot but the man &#8211; the reader knows he is Everett Hughes, the star of the film &#8211; doesn&#8217;t show and Joy walks off the set and into &#8220;<i>the reality of a harsh world</i>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Fourteen months later, Joy has left LA, moved to Chicago, gotten over her cancer, and is teaching at a new school. One day, she&#8217;s having coffee with two of her colleagues, Max and Sarah, when Sarah gasps. The world&#8217;s most famous movie star &#8211; Everett Hughes &#8211; has just walked into the cafe. He&#8217;s in town for the Chicago screening of <i>Maritime</i>. It&#8217;s not until he walks straight up to Joy, calling her name, and reminding her that they&#8217;ve met before &#8211; &#8220;You gave me the starburst tattoo.&#8221; &#8211; that Joy realizes she&#8217;d gone down on Everett Hughes. (&#8220;I thought he was an extra,&#8221; she tells her friends as he stares at her.) Everett asks Joy if he can speak with her alone and asks her why she never met him. The two realize they both waited for hours at different places on the set. Everett asks her to be his date at the Chicago premiere of his movie &#8211; it&#8217;s the number one film in the country &#8211; and Joy, despite thinking he is literally out of her world, agrees.</p>\n<p>The two begin sexual relationship almost immediately, one in which Everett calls the shots. Joy keeps her cancer diagnosis a secret from Everett &#8211; she&#8217;s told almost no one about her past illness &#8211; a choice that allows her to keep a part of herself separate from the tsunami of desire and need that Everett overwhelms her with. Everett is obsessed with Joy; she brings something to his world that his fame, looks, money, and talent do not. He&#8217;s not even sure what that is, he just knows he wants Joy more than he&#8217;s ever wanted anything. I found his focus on her somewhat unbelievable and at times, a little creepy. He knows Joy has put up barriers against him, and for most of the book, he uses his sexual power, talent, and dominance to break down her defenses. This trade-off could have been interesting &#8211; Joy has the power in the emotional part of their relationship while Everett has the power in bed &#8211; but it didn&#8217;t quite work for me. Joy&#8217;s power comes from a stubborn refusal to let anyone get close to her because she rationalizes, if her cancer comes back and she dies, it would be too painful for those who care for her. This frustrated me because it is clear her distance is just as painful for those around her &#8211; her Uncle, her friends, and Everett. She&#8217;s not strong as much as she is fortified by fear.</p>\n<p>I also found Everett hard to connect to. He&#8217;s the world&#8217;s biggest star, handsome beyond belief, a perfect brother, Tantrically fantastic in bed, lovely to all &#8211; I just didn&#8217;t buy him as remotely real. He is the stuff of fantasies and seemed out of place in this love story which is grounded in Joy&#8217;s every day life. He and Joy, well, that relationship would only ever exist in fiction.</p>\n<p>As I think back on reading <b>Exposed to You</b>, what I recall the most is being impatient. There&#8217;s lots of sex, but with the exception of the fabulous blowjob, the sex scenes seem slow and almost too clinically described. Outside of the sex, not much happens. Joy pulls away, Everett uses sex to pull her close, the reader keeps wondering when on earth she&#8217;s going to tell this man she&#8217;ll let do anything to her that, hey, she&#8217;s a recent cancer survivor and still a little freaked out from the whole &#8220;I realized I could die&#8221; experience. I appreciated her fear, but couldn&#8217;t become invested in her happiness or future with Everett.</p>\n<p>I have enjoyed Ms. Kerry&#8217;s other works &#8211; <a href=\"https://amzn.to/41qD3vI\"><b>Sweet Restraint</b></a> is one of my favorite erotic novels. <b>Exposed to You</b> didn&#8217;t engage me or arouse me in the way that other Kerry works have. Except for that first chapter. That is worth reading.</p>\n",

The atmosphere between the two of them becomes saturated with desire and by the time she finishes the tattoo, Joy longs to touch him intimately. She does &#8211; with his permission; she doesn&#8217;t know his name &#8211; and the two share the most erotic experience of their lives. They agree to meet at the end of the shoot but the man &#8211; the reader knows he is Everett Hughes, the star of the film &#8211; doesn&#8217;t show and Joy walks off the set and into &#8220;the reality of a harsh world.&#8221; Fourteen months later, Joy has left LA, moved to Chicago, gotten over her cancer, and is teaching at a new school. One day, she&#8217;s having coffee with two of her colleagues, Max and Sarah, when Sarah gasps. The world&#8217;s most famous movie star &#8211; Everett Hughes &#8211; has just walked into the cafe. He&#8217;s in town for the Chicago screening of Maritime. It&#8217;s not until he walks straight up to Joy, calling her name, and reminding her that they&#8217;ve met before &#8211; &#8220;You gave me the starburst tattoo.&#8221; &#8211; that Joy realizes she&#8217;d gone down on Everett Hughes. (&#8220;I thought he was an extra,&#8221; she tells her friends as he stares at her.) Everett asks Joy if he can speak with her alone and asks her why she never met him. The two realize they both waited for hours at different places on the set. Everett asks her to be his date at the Chicago premiere of his movie &#8211; it&#8217;s the number one film in the country &#8211; and Joy, despite thinking he is literally out of her world, agrees. The two begin sexual relationship almost immediately, one in which Everett calls the shots. Joy keeps her cancer diagnosis a secret from Everett &#8211; she&#8217;s told almost no one about her past illness &#8211; a choice that allows her to keep a part of herself separate from the tsunami of desire and need that Everett overwhelms her with. Everett is obsessed with Joy; she brings something to his world that his fame, looks, money, and talent do not. He&#8217;s not even sure what that is, he just knows he wants Joy more than he&#8217;s ever wanted anything. I found his focus on her somewhat unbelievable and at times, a little creepy. He knows Joy has put up barriers against him, and for most of the book, he uses his sexual power, talent, and dominance to break down her defenses. This trade-off could have been interesting &#8211; Joy has the power in the emotional part of their relationship while Everett has the power in bed &#8211; but it didn&#8217;t quite work for me. Joy&#8217;s power comes from a stubborn refusal to let anyone get close to her because she rationalizes, if her cancer comes back and she dies, it would be too painful for those who care for her. This frustrated me because it is clear her distance is just as painful for those around her &#8211; her Uncle, her friends, and Everett. She&#8217;s not strong as much as she is fortified by fear. I also found Everett hard to connect to. He&#8217;s the world&#8217;s biggest star, handsome beyond belief, a perfect brother, Tantrically fantastic in bed, lovely to all &#8211; I just didn&#8217;t buy him as remotely real. He is the stuff of fantasies and seemed out of place in this love story which is grounded in Joy&#8217;s every day life. He and Joy, well, that relationship would only ever exist in fiction. As I think back on reading Exposed to You, what I recall the most is being impatient. There&#8217;s lots of sex, but with the exception of the fabulous blowjob, the sex scenes seem slow and almost too clinically described. Outside of the sex, not much happens. Joy pulls away, Everett uses sex to pull her close, the reader keeps wondering when on earth she&#8217;s going to tell this man she&#8217;ll let do anything to her that, hey, she&#8217;s a recent cancer survivor and still a little freaked out from the whole &#8220;I realized I could die&#8221; experience. I appreciated her fear, but couldn&#8217;t become invested in her happiness or future with Everett. I have enjoyed Ms. Kerry&#8217;s other works &#8211; Sweet Restraint is one of my favorite erotic novels. Exposed to You didn&#8217;t engage me or arouse me in the way that other Kerry works have. Except for that first chapter. That is worth reading."

He keeps his royalty a secret from Bronte and yet is angry when she keeps things from him. He’s also so wealthy it seems unreal and too often he uses his wealth to impress Bronte.

For starters, it’s a story many adore: brassy girl finds true love with a handsome, fabulously wealthy Duke. The novel portrays the “royal” life in England as one of endless wealth, jewels, fine wine, and gorgeous castles. Ms. Mulry’s writing is often funny and she’s good with descriptive phrasing.

                "html": "<p>Lisa Marie Rice’s latest, <b>Heart of Danger</b>, is the first in her new series <i><b>Ghost Ops</b></i>. The premise of the series is fairly outrageous. The books are set ten years after the death of Osama Bin Laden and the heroes are members of the “famed SEAL Team Six” that killed him. (Bin Laden was indeed taken out by a real Team Six.) In Ms. Rice’s series, a subset of Team Six became a group of an elite secret military unit called “Ghost Ops.” This group was framed for an illegal botched attack on US soil and court-martialed. Before they could be tried, however, they vanished, and are still being sought by the US government.</p>\n<p>This premise didn’t bother me — Ms. Rice’s books are so far-fetched this seemed to be just more of her usual zaniness. I’ve never read a book of hers without rolling my eyes repeatedly, but despite that, I keep reading and enjoying her books. She’s dependably erotic, her plots, though improbable, are page turners, and she’s great with characterization and dialog. I’ve been entertained by many of her books; this one, however, didn’t float my boat.</p>\n<p>Tom McEnroe along with two other Team Sixers — now Ghost Ops guys — were on a mission to destroy the Arka Pharmaceutical Laboratories in Massachusetts which they thought was producing a deadly biological weapon. The mission was a disaster — their intel was bogus — and the three men just barely escaped. They vanished, went totally off the grid, and now live in a compound hidden deep in a mountain. Even though this compound is so secret they’ve never been discovered by all the best minds in the CIA, FBI, etc&#8230;, the place has become home to others — men and women who also need to disappear &#8211; who have found their way there. Tom and his compatriots survive — and boy do they survive; the compound is a Shangri-La of a place — by electronically stealing millions from evil drug lords.</p>\n<p>Catherine Young is an uber-brilliant neuro-scientist who works at an Arka research facility in Northern California studying dementia. She thinks she’s doing work that will lead to a cure but in reality the head of the lab is a depraved nut-case attempting to develop a drug that will turn men into super soldiers. Dr. Lee is doing this because he plans to create an undefeatable army for his home country of China. His favorite man to experiment on is the former head of Team Six, Lucius Ward, whose men he think betrayed them in the blown-up lab incident. Tom and the other Ghost Op guys think Lucius is off enjoying ill-gotten gains, but really the poor guy is being tortured by Dr. Lee who keeps trying all his nasty super soldier drugs out on him. Most subjects die when exposed to the various derivations of this drug, but Lucius — a real life super soldier — has stayed alive.</p>\n<p>Still with me? Because that’s just the set-up.</p>\n<p>Catherine has a secret super power — she can read someone’s emotions just by touching the person.

                "text": "Lisa Marie Rice’s latest, Heart of Danger, is the first in her new series Ghost Ops. The premise of the series is fairly outrageous. The books are set ten years after the death of Osama Bin Laden and the heroes are members of the “famed SEAL Team Six” that killed him. (Bin Laden was indeed taken out by a real Team Six.) In Ms. Rice’s series, a subset of Team Six became a group of an elite secret military unit called “Ghost Ops.” This group was framed for an illegal botched attack on US soil and court-martialed. Before they could be tried, however, they vanished, and are still being sought by the US government. This premise didn’t bother me — Ms. Rice’s books are so far-fetched this seemed to be just more of her usual zaniness. I’ve never read a book of hers without rolling my eyes repeatedly, but despite that, I keep reading and enjoying her books. She’s dependably erotic, her plots, though improbable, are page turners, and she’s great with characterization and dialog. I’ve been entertained by many of her books; this one, however, didn’t float my boat. Tom McEnroe along with two other Team Sixers — now Ghost Ops guys — were on a mission to destroy the Arka Pharmaceutical Laboratories in Massachusetts which they thought was producing a deadly biological weapon. The mission was a disaster — their intel was bogus — and the three men just barely escaped. They vanished, went totally off the grid, and now live in a compound hidden deep in a mountain. Even though this compound is so secret they’ve never been discovered by all the best minds in the CIA, FBI, etc&#8230;, the place has become home to others — men and women who also need to disappear &#8211; who have found their way there. Tom and his compatriots survive — and boy do they survive; the compound is a Shangri-La of a place — by electronically stealing millions from evil drug lords. Catherine Young is an uber-brilliant neuro-scientist who works at an Arka research facility in Northern California studying dementia. She thinks she’s doing work that will lead to a cure but in reality the head of the lab is a depraved nut-case attempting to develop a drug that will turn men into super soldiers. Dr. Lee is doing this because he plans to create an undefeatable army for his home country of China. His favorite man to experiment on is the former head of Team Six, Lucius Ward, whose men he think betrayed them in the blown-up lab incident. Tom and the other Ghost Op guys think Lucius is off enjoying ill-gotten gains, but really the poor guy is being tortured by Dr. Lee who keeps trying all his nasty super soldier drugs out on him. Most subjects die when exposed to the various derivations of this drug, but Lucius — a real life super soldier — has stayed alive. Still with me? Because that’s just the set-up. Catherine has a secret super power — she can read someone’s emotions just by touching the person. She’s kept this a secret from most — it freaks out people — and Dr. Lee does not know she can do this. This is important because Catherine is allowed to study Lucius who seems, most of the time, almost comatose. He, however, has recently begun sending Catherine telepathic messages. These messages tell her she must get in her little electric car, drive up a mountain in a snowstorm, and find Tom McEnroe. So, she does this, almost freezes to death, and is rescued by — bingo — Tom McEnroe whose hideout is in the mountain. Tom brings her back to his world — he can do this because he has a drug that will completely wipe her memory of being in the compound if need be — and grills her. She tells him she was sent by Lucius and that not only is Lucius alive (and not evil), he and several other Ghost Op men are being held in the Arka Lab and are on the verge of death. They must be rescued! Tom and his crew — their technology makes James Bond’s look like the printing press — run checks on Catherine and decide to let her stay in their compound while they research Arka and a whole host of other things that involve rescuing their team.

                "html": "<p>So, if I’d had a heart attack at twenty-seven and had been told by my physicians I needed to decrease the stress in my life, and if my three closest friends responded to this crisis by tricking me into going to a knitting retreat —especially given that neither I nor the heroine of this book knit — my stress level would soar to stratospheric levels. That sort of “we love you and know what’s best for you despite the fact you’re a grown up successful woman” strikes me as manipulative and condescending. So, given that’s the opening plot device in <b>An Accidental Bride</b>, it’s safe to say this book and I did not get off to a good start.</p>\n<p>Jilly O’Hara is a driven chef who owns a wildly popular restaurant in Scottsdale, Arizona. She’s busted her butt for years and is now at the top of her game. Then, one hectic Saturday night, she has a heart attack at work and is subsequently told by doctors she needs six stress free months — no work and all relaxing play. Jilly is appalled. Her cooking empire will collapse without her, she hasn’t any hobbies, and she’s terrified of boredom. So, rather than work with her to come up with a plan she might have some say in, her three best friends stage an “intervention” and pack her off to a knitting retreat high in the mountains of rural Wyoming. (Hilariously, to me at least, the higher altitude is initially a bit rough on her cardiac system.) Jilly has no idea she’s headed for the Lost Creek Resort until she arrives there.</p>\n<p>She’s a bit distracted by the time she arrives at the resort because, at the itty bitty airport she flew into, she met a man. And boy does he strike her as a <b><i>man</i></b>. Not only is he a whole lot of hunky, strong, and silent guy, he’s accompanied by an adorable dog. (This would be the time to confess pets in stories rarely excite me.) Jilly and Winslow — the dog — fall in love at first pet. Jilly and Winslow’s owner, the taciturn Walker Hale, take notice of each other as well — although there’s no petting — heavy or otherwise — between them.</p>\n<p>This is a pretty straight forward love story for the first two thirds of the book.

                "text": "So, if I’d had a heart attack at twenty-seven and had been told by my physicians I needed to decrease the stress in my life, and if my three closest friends responded to this crisis by tricking me into going to a knitting retreat —especially given that neither I nor the heroine of this book knit — my stress level would soar to stratospheric levels. That sort of “we love you and know what’s best for you despite the fact you’re a grown up successful woman” strikes me as manipulative and condescending. So, given that’s the opening plot device in An Accidental Bride, it’s safe to say this book and I did not get off to a good start. Jilly O’Hara is a driven chef who owns a wildly popular restaurant in Scottsdale, Arizona. She’s busted her butt for years and is now at the top of her game. Then, one hectic Saturday night, she has a heart attack at work and is subsequently told by doctors she needs six stress free months — no work and all relaxing play. Jilly is appalled. Her cooking empire will collapse without her, she hasn’t any hobbies, and she’s terrified of boredom. So, rather than work with her to come up with a plan she might have some say in, her three best friends stage an “intervention” and pack her off to a knitting retreat high in the mountains of rural Wyoming. (Hilariously, to me at least, the higher altitude is initially a bit rough on her cardiac system.) Jilly has no idea she’s headed for the Lost Creek Resort until she arrives there. She’s a bit distracted by the time she arrives at the resort because, at the itty bitty airport she flew into, she met a man. And boy does he strike her as a man. Not only is he a whole lot of hunky, strong, and silent guy, he’s accompanied by an adorable dog. (This would be the time to confess pets in stories rarely excite me.) Jilly and Winslow — the dog — fall in love at first pet. Jilly and Winslow’s owner, the taciturn Walker Hale, take notice of each other as well — although there’s no petting — heavy or otherwise — between them. This is a pretty straight forward love story for the first two thirds of the book. Jilly and Walker grow to know one another and they begin to let down the barriers they’ve put up against the world. They are surrounded by lovable and loving characters in the small Wyoming town, all of whom would love to see Walker, the town hero, fall in love and settle down for some well-deserved happiness. I found much of this book unobjectionable, but not especially memorable. Then, two thirds of the way through the novel, an odious plot twist appears.

He doesn’t believe in love — he’s divorced and his mama abandoned him when he was twelve — but he sure does believe in lust. So when the girl of his teenage erotic dreams returns to town, he can’t stop thinking about getting her out of her clothes and into his bed.

June was eighteen when Luke shattered her dreams of the two of them living happily ever after, and as soon as she could, she left Sultry Springs.

                "html": "<p><b>One Naughty Night</b> sat on my review pile for far too long. It’s the first book in Laurel McKee’s new historical series, <i><b>The Scandalous St. Clairs</b></i>; when I realized the next comes out in just two months, I knew it was time to get reading and writing. The thing is, my initial instinct was right: this isn’t a book I loved. I didn’t hate it but the lack of chemistry between the leads combined with a shallow plot didn’t hold my interest.</p>\n<p>For starters, the novel and the series are based on a premise that makes me impatient. One hundred years ago, the Huntingtons, now a wealthy and influential family in the ton — the head of the family is the Duke of Carston &#8211; ruined the St. Clairs. The St. Clairs, wealthy but not of the ton (they are successful theater owners and actors), still loathe the Huntingtons, even though for almost a century, the Huntingtons have done nothing to harm them. The two families are like the Capulets and the Montagues without any current drama.

                "text": "One Naughty Night sat on my review pile for far too long. It’s the first book in Laurel McKee’s new historical series, The Scandalous St. Clairs; when I realized the next comes out in just two months, I knew it was time to get reading and writing. The thing is, my initial instinct was right: this isn’t a book I loved. I didn’t hate it but the lack of chemistry between the leads combined with a shallow plot didn’t hold my interest. For starters, the novel and the series are based on a premise that makes me impatient. One hundred years ago, the Huntingtons, now a wealthy and influential family in the ton — the head of the family is the Duke of Carston &#8211; ruined the St. Clairs. The St. Clairs, wealthy but not of the ton (they are successful theater owners and actors), still loathe the Huntingtons, even though for almost a century, the Huntingtons have done nothing to harm them. The two families are like the Capulets and the Montagues without any current drama. This irked me — the St. Clairs are wealthy and happy; their obsession with an ancient wrong struck me as silly. In One Naughty Night, the star-crossed lovers are Lily St. Clair and Aidan Huntington. Both are somewhat set apart from their families. Lily was raised by a drug addicted whore in a brothel.

She was raised in the harsh Margate school for girls where she was deposited when she was five. She’s tried for years to learn something of her past — she’s written requests to countless English parish registers asking for information about a girl born between 1790 and 1792 named Katherine — but has never found from whence she came.

He thinks she’s the most beautiful woman in the world, but not only does his checkered past make him “wrong” for her, he knows the truth about her past and it’s one he doesn’t want her to find out.</p>\n<p>Their story didn’t quite work for me. As I mentioned in the beginning of this review, I’ve grown tired of the “I love you, I spend all my time trying to ensure your safety, but I’m not good enough for you” hero. It’s been clear since the first book in the series Thorne is a stand-up guy, a leader, and a profoundly loyal friend. Kate is alone in the world; she thinks she’s unattractive because she has a port-wine stain on her brow—it seemed almost cruel to me for Thorne to continually rebuff her all in the name of his supposed worthlessness.

Three of the books, including this one, feature siblings who run the Home for Unfortunate Infants and Foundling Children in the London slum of St. Giles. The hero of this book, Winter Makepeace, is by day a grave, severe man soberly devoted to running the Home. At night, however, Winter dons a harlequin’s costume and patrols the roads and roofs of the slums, saving innocents from all matter of evil. One night, after freeing the pirate Mickey (hero of <b>Scandalous Desires</b>), Winter is fighting an angry mob for his life when he is suddenly rescued by Lady Isabel Beckinhall. <b>Thief of Shadows</b> is the tale of their decidedly implausible love.</p>\n<p>Isabel is well-acquainted with Winter Makepeace but has no idea, even after she takes off every inch of his clothes (except for a thin black scarf covering the top half of his head) that he&#8217;s the Ghost of St. Giles. Winter is the dull, rather infuriating man who runs the Home of which she is a major Patroness. (She undresses him, after rescuing him and taking him back to her home, in order to tend to a bad wound he has on his leg.) Winter asks her not to unmask him and, after she’s ogled his hard, ridged muscled body and his “cock thick and long, even at rest, his bollocks heavy,” flirted with him, and had him reject her advances, she sews up his leg and lets him escape.</p>\n<p>Three days later, as Winter attends to the children at the Home, Isabel appears with a proposition for Mr. Makepeace. Isabel and several other wealthy women have essentially taken on financial responsibility for the Home. Their coterie, the Lady’s Syndicate, has done great good for the home —their benevolence enabled the orphanage to move into a much larger, better built building — and the women plan to continue their improvements. In order to do so, however, they plan to raise money from others of their class. And there are those in the Syndicate — chiefly the very wealthy and very shallow Lady Penelope Chadwicke, the daughter of the Earl of Brightmore — who do not feel that Winter is up to the task of mingling with his betters. Lady Penelope and her supporters believe the Home would be better served by a far more refined manager. Not all in the Syndicate agree with Penelope however, and a compromise is worked out. Rather than fire Mr. Makepeace, one of the Syndicate will give Winter social etiquette lessons. Given that Isabel is both a widow and known far and wide for her “full understanding of polite society and its intricacies,” she is chosen to be Winter’s social tutor.</p>\n<p>Winter declines her offer, rudely and emphatically, and walks out on Isabel. It is not until several days later, when she comes to tell him Penelope is actively interviewing others for his job, he agrees to put himself under her tutelage. The two begin to socialize together, but their outings keep being interrupted by Winter’s need to rush out and be the Ghost of St. Giles. Someone is snatching little girls off the streets and saving them is even more important to Winter than saving his place at the Home.</p>\n<p>I couldn’t quite make sense of Winter. He decided, when quite young, to devote himself at all costs to caring for those to whom society pays no attention: The destitute, the abandoned, and the ones no one misses.

He can’t allow anything, not even life’s simplest joys, to distract him from his self-appointed role. Winter is not portrayed as a masochist, but rather as a noble virgin hero but, to me, he seemed a few steps up from pathologically depressed. When he falls for Isabel&#8217;s touch — and she works hard to make him give up his celibacy, even fellating him almost against his will — he feels he has failed profoundly. And while it’s true once he accepts his sexual self, he lets go of his self-flagellating guilt, for much of the book, he’s so self-critical it’s hard believe he’d ever be capable of happiness.</p>\n<p>Isabel is a lovely woman and I enjoyed her much more than Winter. She — thanks to a far thinking older husband — is independently wealthy. She’s smart, and in general lives life on her own terms. If Winter tamps down all his feelings, Isabella revels in hers. She’s very attracted to Winter — especially once she figures out he and the Ghost are the same — and she goes after him with great passion. (I did feel somewhat discomfited by her actions — she knows he wants to stay pure and she, sure he’ll be happier if he knows joy in his life, ignores his wishes.)

In Ms. Chase’s latest, <b>Scandal Wears Satin</b>, the second in her <i><b>Dressmakers</b></i> series, the answer is a resounding and yet unbelievable yes. The novel, written with Ms. Chase’s usual verve and humor, tells the story of Sophy Noirot and Harry, the Earl of Longmore. It&#8217;s a steamy, exceedingly enjoyable read. It reads like a fairy tale written for grown-ups: Whimsical, unpredictable, and fantastical. In the proverbial real world, there’s no way these two lovers would find their happy ending, but in this giddy novel they do. Readers willing to suspend disbelief will enjoy this book tremendously; those who like their fiction grounded in gritty reality will not.</p>\n<p>The two were introduced in the first novel in the series, <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/silk-is-for-seduction-by-loretta-chase/\"><b>Silk for Seduction</b></a>. In that book, Harry’s best friend, the Duke of Clevedon, marries Sophy’s sister, Marcelline, rather than Harry’s younger sister Clara. Their wedding causes all sorts of trouble for the Noirot sisters and their dress shop, Maison Noirot. For starters, Clara’s mother now loathes the Noirots with a snooty passion. Furthermore, the ton, shocked by a modiste stealing one of their own, shuns Maison Noirot. The shop is on the verge of collapse and Sophy and her younger sister Leonie, unwilling to live off their brother-in-law’s largesse, are terrified. They have one — and only one — customer from the upper echelons of society: Lady Clara, Harry’s sister. Clara, quite content to not be married to Clevedon, has become friends with the Noirot sisters and, despite her mother’s ire, continues to frequent their shop.</p>\n<p>When Clara is very publically compromised by the worthless — in more ways than one — Lord Adderly and is forced to become engaged to the cad, Harry is ready to kill the man. Sophy, however, persuades him to calm down. She assures him, despite having no idea how she will accomplish this, that she and her sisters will “un-ruin” Clara and save her from marriage to the mendacious Lord Adderly. But when Clara’s mother insists the wedding will take place in a matter of weeks, Clara runs away, and it is up to Harry, accompanied by Sophy, to fetch her back.</p>\n<p>Sophy is a wonderful heroine. She’s smart and capable — she never stops thinking, analyzing each and every situation and character she encounters. She’s an actress of extraordinary talents — she continually dons new personas and outfits, and with each change, she becomes whoever she needs to be at that moment. It’s great fun to watch Sophy bamboozle pretty much everyone and even greater fun to watch her unable to do the same to Harry. Harry may not be as smart as Sophy but he views the world very clearly, and no matter what scheme Sophy is running, Harry always sees the Sophy behind the act. This ability of Harry’s makes him — along with his overt sensuality — irresistible to Sophie.</p>\n<p>Harry is not quite as entrancing as Sophy. He’s an earl, and until he took up chasing after first Sophy and then his sister, he does little of importance. He is, I suppose, representative of many titled men of his time, but his lack of life goals makes him seem somehow lesser than driven Sophy. That said, he’s the right guy for her. She is so tightly wound that Harry, with his easy-going, devil may care attitude is just what she needs to help her relax and enjoy life. The two are lovely together — as usual Ms. Chase has done a marvelous job with the sexual tension between the pair. The book starts with both lovers lusting madly for one another. As they journey after Clara, they move from lust to something scarily close to love; both journeys are well-written and fun to follow.</p>\n<p>I took great pleasure in this book. The romance is engaging, the sex scenes are wonderfully steamy and compliment the emotional relationship between the lovers. The plot is intriguing — it proves to be quite a challenge to “un-ruin” Clara — and the secondary characters add depth and wit to the tale. <b>Scandal Wears Satin</b> tells a great story, full of heat, humor, and heart. It is, however, very much a story. In this book, as in the first in the series, <b>Silk is for Seduction</b>, the happy ending the lovers find can only exist in fiction. In the real world of 1830’s England, much of what transpires in this novel could never happen. That’s fine with me. Ms. Chase’s historical romances aren’t celebrated for their period authenticity.

Mallory, a nurse and the sort who tries to save anyone she thinks needs saving, bravely steps out into the howling storm and almost steps on a large semi-conscious male who looks to have been knocked out by a fallen tree branch. He’s bleeding from the head and as Mallory tries to examine him she realizes he’s the man known on Lucky Harbor’s exceedingly popular Facebook page as Mysterious Cute Guy. MCG has been in Lucky Harbor for six months and no one knows anything about him at all — except of course that he’s one fine-looking man.

Mallory is a grade A good girl.

The auction, organized by Mallory, is a fundraiser for the future clinic and most of Lucky Harbor is there.

Ty quit the military after losing his entire team in a plane crash four years ago and has since been working as a private contractor. He’s currently out of action — he reinjured himself on a mission jumping out a second story window — and is counting down the days until he will be cleared by his doctor — Lucky Harbor’s Dr. Josh Scott &#8211; to return to work. Ty’s in Lucky Harbor, renting a house found by his friend Matt, a local forest ranger Ty went through naval basic training with years ago. Ty is a loner who doesn’t do relationships. All that matters to him is getting back to the job — he believes that the only way he can atone for surviving the crash that killed his team is to keep going out on missions and saving those in need.</p>\n<p>Ty goes to the auction, hoping (against his better judgment) to see “his bossy, warm, sexy nurse” again.

Ty steps up to the plate, helping out with auction, getting the bidding going, and in general, charming the hell out of Mallory who is already aswoon at how hot he looks cleaned up in his tux. Mallory finds him so charming, in fact, when the two find themselves in a deserted storage room looking for a misplaced vase, Mallory, who has never had sex outside a committed relationship in her life, pretty much throws herself at Ty. The two share a super-charged kiss and just as Mallory is about to pass out from desire, Ty tells her they’re stopping. Mallory asks why.</p>\n<blockquote><p>He let out a low, innately male groan. “Because you’re not the fuck-a-stranger-in-a-storage-room-with-her-boss waiting type of woman.” Well, when he put it like that&#8230;Damn. Her inner bad girl retreated a little. More than a little….<br />\n“I am for tonight,” she said, and wrapped herself around him. “Mallory.” He stared down at her, the moonlight casting his features into relief. “I’m not a long-term bet. Hell, I’m not even a short-term bet.”<br />\n“I just want this,” she said. “Here. Now. With you.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Anyone has ever read a romance knows how this story goes. The fun of the book is that even though the reader knows it’s only a matter of time until Ty realizes his future lies with Mallory, Ms. Shalvis tells that story with panache and humor. This is a very witty — I laughed out loud countless times reading <b>Lucky in Love</b> — and terrifically well-written book. The secondary characters — and the town counts as one — are hilarious and differentiated. Fans of the earlier books will love seeing Lucky Harbor’s denizens again at their meddling best. <b>Lucky in Love</b> is also one of the hottest books I’ve read by Ms. Shalvis.

                "html": "<p>Perhaps my favorite novella in romance is <b>This Wicked Gift, </b> written and published by Ms. Milan in 2009. In it, Ms. Milan presents a hero who forces the heroine to make love with him. Things, however, are not what they seem, and in that tale, what the hero thinks is forced is really a gift willingly bestowed by the heroine. In Ms. Milan’s latest novella, also a marvelous piece, the heroine, Serena Barton, <b><i>is</i></b> forced to have sex against her will. Her experience leaves her pregnant, ashamed, and determined to make her rapist, the Duke of Clermont, acknowledge both his crime and his unborn child. The Duke, a weak and morally bereft man, has no intention of doing any such thing. He asks the man who handles all his affairs, the fearsome Hugo Marshall, to silence Serena. <b>The Governess Affair</b> tells their story and does so with splendor and insight.</p>\n<p>Three months ago, Serena was working as a governess for a family whom the Duke of Clermont came to visit. The Duke came to her room one night, forced himself on Serena, took her virginity, and left her pregnant. Serena feels complicit in her own rape because she didn’t fight him. Now, Serena is determined to regain her sense of herself and her life. As she says, <i>“I am done with things happening to me. From here on out, <b>I</b> am going to happen to things.”</i></p>\n<p>Serena has confronted the Duke and he has ignored her. She decides to sit on a bench in front of his house until she receives compensation <b><i>and</i></b> recognition. Her behavior couldn’t come at a worse time for the Duke. He’s deeply in need of funds he can only get from his new wife’s guardian and the Duke has been such a terrible husband to his Duchess that she’s run off and abandoned him. The last thing the Duke needs is for his wife to find out he “seduced” and impregnated some other woman. So the Duke does what he always does when he needs any problem solved: He turns the matter over to his man of business, the Wolf of Clermont, an ex-boxer feared by all for the effective ruthlessness he employs against those who threaten the Duke. This man, Hugo, does indeed handle all the Duke’s affairs, but he does so not out of any loyalty to the Duke — Hugo thinks the man is an idiot and a slacker — but because the money he can earn working for the Duke will allow Hugo to accomplish his lifelong dream of being the “richest coal miner’s son in all of England.”</p>\n<p>When the Duke tells Hugo to make Serena quietly go away, the Duke does not tell Hugo the truth about what he did to Serena. Hugo knows the Duke is lying about something but he doesn’t care. The governess exists to Hugo only as a problem to solve, by means fair or foul. Hugo strolls out to the bench to have a conversation with Serena, one he hopes will get her to see she has no choice but to take the fifty pounds the Duke is willing to offer her and then vanish. Serena, however, is not what Hugo was expecting, nor is she willing to take his paltry offer. Over the next week, Serena and Hugo continue to converse, each unwilling to back down. Every conversation the two share fuels a growing attraction between them, one that Hugo doesn’t want and that Serena sees with hope.</p>\n<p>God, I loved their story. Hugo is a complicated man and his struggle to choose between doing the Duke’s biding and his unwanted feelings for Serena is extremely difficult for him. He, a man who prides himself on never hurting women, is forced to acknowledge his actions, while not physical, could cause Serena harm. His reaction, when he learns the truth about what the Duke did to Serena, makes it clear to himself and to the reader that Hugo is indeed the man Serena wishes he is.</p>\n<p>As for Serena, she’s not only a wonderful character, full of wit and resolve; she gives voice and hope, in ways that made me cry, to women who have been raped. First by confronting the Duke, then by deliberately choosing Hugo — even when he doesn’t want her to — Serena drives away her fear and her guilt. There’s a scene — a gorgeous, sexy, incredible scene — near the book’s end, where Serena and Hugo make love. I wish every woman ever raped could have the experience written in <b>The Governess Affair</b>. Ms. Milan makes the way Serena and Hugo conquer the memory of Serena’s rape believable and beautiful. Rape is a crime of violence and power — Hugo knows this and thus, when he gives his body to Serena, he does so in a way that heals Serena by replacing her feelings of pain and shame with those of pleasure and intimacy.</p>\n<p>The novella is a prequel to a new series by Ms. Milan called <b><i>The Brothers Sinister</i></b>. The last chapter of <b>The Governess Affair</b>(also really well done) takes place <i>“not quite twelve years later” </i> at Eton and recounts the first time the Duke’s two sons, Robert (the Duchess of Clermont’s son) and Oliver (Serena’s son) meet. Robert is the hero in the first book, <b>The Duchess Wars</b>, which will be released this summer. I can’t wait.</p>\n",

This man, Hugo, does indeed handle all the Duke’s affairs, but he does so not out of any loyalty to the Duke — Hugo thinks the man is an idiot and a slacker — but because the money he can earn working for the Duke will allow Hugo to accomplish his lifelong dream of being the “richest coal miner’s son in all of England.” When the Duke tells Hugo to make Serena quietly go away, the Duke does not tell Hugo the truth about what he did to Serena. Hugo knows the Duke is lying about something but he doesn’t care. The governess exists to Hugo only as a problem to solve, by means fair or foul. Hugo strolls out to the bench to have a conversation with Serena, one he hopes will get her to see she has no choice but to take the fifty pounds the Duke is willing to offer her and then vanish. Serena, however, is not what Hugo was expecting, nor is she willing to take his paltry offer. Over the next week, Serena and Hugo continue to converse, each unwilling to back down. Every conversation the two share fuels a growing attraction between them, one that Hugo doesn’t want and that Serena sees with hope. God, I loved their story. Hugo is a complicated man and his struggle to choose between doing the Duke’s biding and his unwanted feelings for Serena is extremely difficult for him. He, a man who prides himself on never hurting women, is forced to acknowledge his actions, while not physical, could cause Serena harm. His reaction, when he learns the truth about what the Duke did to Serena, makes it clear to himself and to the reader that Hugo is indeed the man Serena wishes he is. As for Serena, she’s not only a wonderful character, full of wit and resolve; she gives voice and hope, in ways that made me cry, to women who have been raped. First by confronting the Duke, then by deliberately choosing Hugo — even when he doesn’t want her to — Serena drives away her fear and her guilt. There’s a scene — a gorgeous, sexy, incredible scene — near the book’s end, where Serena and Hugo make love. I wish every woman ever raped could have the experience written in The Governess Affair. Ms. Milan makes the way Serena and Hugo conquer the memory of Serena’s rape believable and beautiful. Rape is a crime of violence and power — Hugo knows this and thus, when he gives his body to Serena, he does so in a way that heals Serena by replacing her feelings of pain and shame with those of pleasure and intimacy. The novella is a prequel to a new series by Ms. Milan called The Brothers Sinister. The last chapter of The Governess Affair(also really well done) takes place “not quite twelve years later” at Eton and recounts the first time the Duke’s two sons, Robert (the Duchess of Clermont’s son) and Oliver (Serena’s son) meet. Robert is the hero in the first book, The Duchess Wars, which will be released this summer. I can’t wait."

In Ms. Thomas’s latest historical romance, <b>Beguiling the Beauty</b>, the allure of her heroine Venetia rivals that of Helen. It is Venetia’s extraordinary beauty that ensnares Christian, the Duke of Lexington, in 1886, when he’s a student at Harrow and sees her at a cricket match. And it is her beauty and the way it shapes both their lives that, over the next the next ten years, nearly destroys them both. Their story, written by Sherry Thomas with poignant radiance, is every bit as lovely as Venetia and will ensnare all but the most chary of mortals.</p>\n<p>The book begins with this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It happened one sunlit day in the summer of 1886. Until then, Christian de Montfort, the young Duke of Lexington, had led a charmed life.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On that day, Christian, a brilliant budding naturalist, is playing in the annual Harrow vs. Eton match when he suddenly sees, sitting on a phaeton on the far edge of the field, a young woman.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Her face — he lost his breath. He’d never encountered beauty of such magnitude and intensity. It was not allure, but grace, like the sight of land to a shipwrecked man. And he, who hadn’t been on a capsized vessel since he was six — and that had only been an overturned canoe — suddenly felt as if he’d been adrift in the open ocean his entire life. Someone spoke to him. He couldn’t make out a single word.There was something elemental to her beauty, like a mile-high thunderhead, a gathering avalanche, or a Bengal tiger prowling the darkness of the jungle. A phenomenon of inherent danger and overwhelming perfection.</p>\n<p>He felt a sharp, sweet ache in his chest: His life would never again be complete without her. But he felt no fear, only excitement, wonder, and desire.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This singular beauty is Venetia Fitzhugh Townsend, and she, much to Christian’s horror, is very much married. Overnight, Christian becomes a changed man. “Until he’d met her, he’d not known envy, misery, or despair.” Now, such emotions are his constant company. Late one night, several years after he first espies Venetia &#8211; to whom he’s never spoken &#8211; Christian encounters her husband, Anthony Townsend, in the quiet library of his club. Anthony, a bitter, destructive man, tells Christian he recognizes him from that day at the cricket game as the man “gawking at his wife.” He elliptically warns Christian about the dangers of loving Venetia and takes his leave.</p>\n<p>The next day, Christian reads in the paper that Anthony Townsend is dead, and his life was in shambles. He was deeply in debt to jewelers and on the verge on bankruptcy. A year later, Venetia marries Mr. Easterbrook, a wealthy man thirty years older than she, and rumors swirl throughout England she’s blatantly unfaithful to her elderly spouse. Christian presumes the great love of his life is “a shallow, greedy, selfish woman who injured and diminished those around her.” He moves on with his life, still obsessed with Venetia, but determined to make sure their paths never cross.</p>\n<p>By 1896, Venetia is again widowed and visiting Boston with her sister, Helena, and her, sister-in-law, Millie. Venetia, who has loved fossils since she found a famous one as a young girl, sees that the famous naturalist Duke of Lexington is giving a speech at Harvard discussing the theories of Darwin and Lamarck. The women decide to go — Venetia and Millie think Christian, from what they’ve heard of him, might make a grand husband for Helena. On the night of the lecture, Christian makes the pronouncement — in the context of answering a question about beauty’s role in Darwinian theory — “beautiful women are essentially untrustworthy,” and recounts, without naming names, his version of Venetia’s life, calling her “Exceptionally heartless, our beauty.” He, of course, has no idea Venetia and her family are in the audience. Venetia is devastated.</p>\n<p>The reality of Venetia’s life is nothing like what Christian described. Venetia’s first husband, too weak to not be threatened by his wife’s pull on all who saw her, ultimately tried to destroy her. Her marriage to Easterbrook was not at all what society believed it to be. When the reader first begins to know Venetia — this only begins to truly happen when Venetia is in Boston — it is clear Venetia’s beauty and its impact on others are not what she and those who love her value in her. She’s a woman of great character and intellect whose life, in large part <b><i>because</i></b> of her beauty, has held a fair share of loneliness and misery. When Christian assails her in public, she’s undone — his assertions bring up all her pain over the last ten years.</p>\n<p>She, needing time to be alone and lick her proverbial wounds, tells her family she’d like to leave Boston early and travel to New York to stay for a few days before the three set sail back to England. When she arrives in the city, she — and this is key — dons a veiled driving hat to protect her hair and face as she is driven from Grand Central Station to her hotel. As she steps out of the car, she sees Christian striding into the hotel. Panicked, she keeps the hat on as she steps up to the desk where he too is checking in and, when the desk clerk speaks to her, she answers in German and gives her name as Baronesse von Seidlitz-Hardenberg. As she sees Christian, she realizes she is furious at him for disclosing her personal pain so publically and, impulsively, decides to break his heart. She books a suite on the same boat he is returning to England on and, the next day, still in her veiled hat, boards the ship, and embarks on a trans-Atlantic affair with him, all the while keeping from him who she really is.</p>\n<p>What follows is so wonderfully rendered, I forgave the conceit of the hat. Ms. Thomas’s writing is, as usual, fluid, gorgeous, and sensual. Christian and Venetia discover each other in so many ways in this book — on ship, as lovers who speak in German and make love only in the dark, and then, as their true selves back in England. Their relationship, especially in the last third of the book, is full of pain, and for Christian, betrayal. Like most of Ms. Thomas’s lovers, their ultimate happiness is hard won and, for the reader, genuinely satisfying.</p>\n<p><b>Beguiling the Beauty</b> is not a perfect novel. The love affair between Christian and Venetia is, in a few places, constrained by artifice, and in the latter part of the book, I found Christian’s behavior hard to credit. (My husband read the book as well and disagrees with me about this. He feels, from a man’s perspective, Christian’s behavior is completely understandable.) But, even with its flaws, the book is a delight.</p>\n<p>The book is the first of three, each featuring a Fitzhugh sibling.

The series is built around the whereabouts of a set of ruby jewelry, and in all three books, that plotline has been lackluster. In the first two books, however, the love stories were compelling. In this book, the love story is not. The novel is a depressing read with a strained happy ending. The heroine endures an alcoholic spouse who physically abuses and rapes her; she has a sister who almost justifies sororicide; she loves a man she can never have. Her life, until page 359, is one of misery and I didn’t enjoy reading about it at all.</p>\n<p>The other two books in the series have taken place in Hadley Green and have centered on its leading family, the Ashfords. This novel is set in the village of Everdon and focuses on the Careys. The heroine of this novel, Olivia, is married to the Marquis of Carey; the hero, Harrison Tolley, is the steward of the Carey family holdings. Harrison, a saint of man, is the illegitimate yet legally valid heir to the Ashford title of Earl and corresponding estate. One would think this heritage, which Harrison learns of in the beginning of <b>The Seduction of Lady X</b>, would be a significant plot point. After all, the series has been focused on the secrets hidden by the Ashford family. One would be wrong. In this book, inexplicably, when Harrison is informed he is a wealthy Earl, neither he nor the author does much with that information. Instead, Harrison (and the novel) is focused on his impossible love for Olivia, the married Lady Carey.</p>\n<p>Olivia, a determinedly cheerful beauty, married for love and for money. Her husband married for an heir, and Olivia, after six years, has not conceived. Olivia’s lack of fertility enrages Edward, a horrendous man. Edward’s rage is magnified when Alexa, Olivia’s selfish eighteen year-old sister, arrives at the Carey home, Everdon Court, pregnant and unwed. (The sisters’ parents are dead and they have no other family to turn to.) Edward, already appalling, becomes a monster. He says to Olivia, when she and Alexa come to tell him of Alexa’s plight:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I find it interesting that while you are as barren as a Scottish moor, your sister is a whore who apparently will conceive a by-blow with any man who lifts her skirts.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He berates Olivia repeatedly, beats her, and, finally, rapes her.</p>\n<p>All this abuse is written in a disconcertingly light tone. It’s as if Ms. London is unwilling to acknowledge how awful Olivia’s treatment at the hands of Edward actually is. I had a hard time making myself turn the pages — the way Olivia’s circumstances were described unsettled me.</p>\n<p>Olivia tolerates her husband’s abuse in part because she dreams of being loved by a man like Harrison. Harrison fell in love with Olivia the moment he first saw her and, though he’s never said a word to her about his feelings, she feels joyful whenever he is near her. The two, prior to Alexa’s arrival, exist in a state of tragically unattainable love. But when Edward announces he plans to send Alexa to a convent and have her baby put up for adoption, Harrison, who will do anything to make Olivia’s life more bearable, offers to marry Alexa. Alexa, an unlikable, spoiled chit, only says yes to him when she discovers, by reading his mail, he could be an Earl.

One met a wonderful man, fell in love, married, and <b><i>then</i></b> had sex. In <b>Blame it on Bath</b>, Ms. Linden’s latest enjoyable entry in her <b><i>The Truth about the Duke</i></b> series, heroine Katherine Howe follows that path only to find her husband, Captain Gerard de Lacey, has not. Gerard does wait until after he weds Katherine to bed her. But, much to Katherine’s dismay, he completely skips the falling in love part and appears quite content to do so.</p>\n<p>Gerard is the youngest of the Duke of Durham’s three sons. The three men are currently living under a cloud of suspicion dubbed by society as the Durham Dilemma. On his deathbed, their father confessed a whopping secret: He’d married as a young man then separated from but never divorced the woman. Thus, his marriage to his sons’ mother, the Duchess of Durham, long dead, was quite possibly an invalid one. The Duke never spoke to anyone of his early marriage, but in the months before he died he&#8217;d been receiving blackmail letters threatening to publish proof of his earlier union. Were it to be proven the Duke was indeed married to someone other than Gerard’s mother and that woman had been alive when he wed the Duchess, his three sons would be illegitimate and would lose their fortunes, titles, and entailed properties.</p>\n<p>Gerard’s middle brother, Edward, the hero of the first book in the series, <b>One Night in London</b>, is trying to resolve the problem through Britain’s legal system. Gerard, who has spent his adult life in the army, has no patience for that slow moving process and he decides to track down the blackmailer himself. He also plans to find and wed a wealthy woman before the Durham Dilemma scandal further taints his prospects. If his family does lose everything, Gerard will be left with only a small estate in Cornwall and an annual income of a thousand pounds a year. He, who has grown up as a Duke’s son, doesn’t want a life of comparative poverty and sees marrying for money as the only sure solution to his looming misfortune.</p>\n<p>Two of the four blackmail letters were posted from Bath, and so there Gerald decides to go. On his way, he stops and spends the night at an inn on the outskirts of London. He is musing over his troubles when there is a knock on the door of his room. A servant woman begs him to come to the inn’s private parlor and meet with her mistress, whose name she does not give. Gerard whose “abiding weakness was curiosity,” goes to the parlor and encounters a woman (he thinks) he’s never met before. She introduces herself as Katherine Howe and, after swearing him to secrecy about their meeting, asks him to marry her.</p>\n<p>Katherine is a widow of thirty, considered by most to be a plain, quiet, and serious woman. Her husband died less than a year ago, and she, much to her horror, is being pressured into marrying his heir, a cold and dour man named Lucien Howe. Lucien is desperate to marry Katherine. Katherine is a wealthy woman — she inherited over a hundred thousand pounds from her father. Her husband, Viscount Howe, left Lucien saddled with debt, much of which is owed to Katherine (the note was originally held by Katherine’s father and when he died, it became hers.) Lucien has no way to pay the money he owes and sees marriage to Katherine as the only way he can escape penury. Katherine’s mother Mary, an unpleasant, conniving, vain woman, also wants Katherine to wed Lucien so that she, Mary, will remain the mother-in-law of a wealthy peer. Katherine would rather die than marry the grim and ascetic Lucien but she is increasingly anxious that he and her mother will somehow force her to do so.</p>\n<p>So, knowing of the Durham Dilemma, she seeks out Gerard and offers him her fortune in exchange for his hand. Unlike Gerard, Katherine knows the night she meets him in the inn is not the first time the two have met. Katherine grew up in the same town as Gerard and, twelve years earlier, when Katherine was caught walking in downpour, Gerard came upon her on the road, swept her up onto his horse, and gave her a ride back to her home. That act of consideration on his part stirred something in Katherine’s heart and she’s been in love with him ever since. As she explains it, he was the first man to ever put his arms around her willingly. Her marriage was not a close one; for a dozen years she’s thought of Gerard as <b><i>”Her knight, her hero, the ideal man she had kept in heart.&#8221;</i></b> When she learned of his situation, she decided to pursue him. Not only would marriage to him free her from Lucien’s grasp; finally she’d be with the man she loves. She tells Gerard nothing of their past or her feelings and presents marriage as simply a convenient exchange of her wealth for his protection.</p>\n<p>Gerard, after speaking to Katherine’s solicitor and making sure all she told him is true, meets Katherine three nights later and not only agrees to marry her, but says the two will wed the next day. He tells her theirs will be a real marriage and, if they are blessed, he hopes for children. He kisses her and makes it clear he hopes they both find pleasure in their marital bed. Katherine, who barely tolerated that part of her first marriage, is first shocked and then terrified. She so wants Gerard to grow to care for her as she does for him and she worries her lack of experience will cause him to turn to other women as her husband did. Gerard however has enough experience for them both, and once they’ve married and arrived in Bath — where Gerard works to track down the blackmailer — he and Katherine do find bliss in bed together. Gerard is thrilled— he has financial security and a great sex life — but Katherine, as the days go by, is not. She wants to be more than just her husband’s lover; she wants to be his confidant and in time, love.</p>\n<p>I liked the relationship between Gerard and Katherine. Gerard, whose mother died when he was five, hasn’t ever considered the idea of loving a woman, let alone sharing with her his thoughts and feelings.

                "html": "<p>There’s a line in Jeannie Lin’s novella, <b>Capturing the Silken Thief</b>, that evokes the effortless, lyrical beauty of her tale. A man &#8211; a scholar &#8211; and a woman &#8211; a musician &#8211; meet at night. Ms. Lin writes, “<em>The moon was high and round, with that faint harvest gleam that marked it as a night for recitations of poetry</em>.” The line, like the novella, is self-contained and, at the same time, inviting. A reader wonders what might happen under such a moon and longs to read more.</p>\n<p>The novella so often disappoints. Either its story is too thin or its premise unfulfilled. Ms. Lin’s lovely little work has neither limitation. In 75 pages, she presents a Chinese romance, a love story told in its entirety, from first glance to final promise. Her lovers are limned clearly — we know their past, present, and future. Her heroine, the pipa player Jia, is as real a woman as I’ve ever encountered in the pages of historical romance.

                "text": "There’s a line in Jeannie Lin’s novella, Capturing the Silken Thief, that evokes the effortless, lyrical beauty of her tale. A man &#8211; a scholar &#8211; and a woman &#8211; a musician &#8211; meet at night. Ms. Lin writes, “The moon was high and round, with that faint harvest gleam that marked it as a night for recitations of poetry.” The line, like the novella, is self-contained and, at the same time, inviting. A reader wonders what might happen under such a moon and longs to read more. The novella so often disappoints. Either its story is too thin or its premise unfulfilled. Ms. Lin’s lovely little work has neither limitation. In 75 pages, she presents a Chinese romance, a love story told in its entirety, from first glance to final promise. Her lovers are limned clearly — we know their past, present, and future. Her heroine, the pipa player Jia, is as real a woman as I’ve ever encountered in the pages of historical romance. She’s twenty-three, deeply in debt, smart, talented, and proud. She’s a realist who dreams, schemes, and works for a future where she could live a simple life she’d be able to control. The hero, Cheng, is just as wonderfully rendered. He’s from a poor rural family, able to study in the capital only because of the largess of a local magistrate back home. Like Jia, he is determined to better himself. Together, the two are achingly perfect. They meet because Jia has paid the last of her coin to have street thugs rob Cheng. She has mistaken him for another scholar, a wealthy rude bore, who stole a valuable book from the Lotus Pavilion, the most luxurious gathering place in the city. Jia wants this book so that she may sell it and buy her financial freedom. The street thugs steal Cheng’s books and work, valuable beyond measure to him, and bring them to Jia. Jia realizes Cheng doesn’t have what she seeks; she finds him and offers him back his books for his help in finding the volume she desires. Cheng sees in Jia — whom he thinks is named Rose — something he desires. He agrees to help her, eager to pursue the passion he feels spark between them. I don’t want to share much more of what’s to be found in Capturing the Silken Thief. The love story between Cheng and Jia is flawlessly presented — each remark, touch, and truth they share is exactly what it should be. The setting, the city of Changan during the era of the Tang Dynasty, is vividly portrayed, and the story behind the journal is remarkably moving given the brevity of its presentation.

                "html": "<p>Many a romance novel features an adorable small town, filled with people and places a reader might love to experience. Ballycraig, Ireland, the fictional setting of Ms. Martin’s latest <b><i>New York Blades</i></b> series, is <b><i>not</i></b> such a place. The people there, in general, are economically struggling, tend to drink too much, make self-destructive decisions, and are routinely nasty to each other. The town has little charm. I, like the heroine of <b>Breakaway</b>, Erin O’Brien, wanted to get out of there as soon as I possibly could.</p>\n<p>Erin has lived her entire life in Ballycraig. She once had plans to leave, plans that fell apart when Rory Brady, the love of her life — they began dating when she was fourteen — broke his promise to marry her and bring her to New York City where he plays for the NHL. Rory smashed Erin’s heart so thoroughly it took her two years to recover. Even now, she, and the entire town, hates Rory Brady for dumping her. Now Erin is stuck working night and day for her demanding mother at their family’s B and B, and is determined to leave Ballycraig on her own. She’s been finishing up her degree — on-line — in art history, and as soon as she can, she’s moving to a city somewhere in Ireland, getting a job, and finally seeing the world.</p>\n<p>Rory Brady, on the other hand, has just returned to Ballycraig after four years. He’s realized breaking up with Erin was the biggest mistake he ever made and he’s determined to win her back. He loves his life as a NHL star — he’s the only Irish-born player in the league — and he’s proud of all he’s accomplished. But, he believes there’s “a difference between achievement and contentment.” He won’t be content, won’t have all the success he wants, until he’s got Erin back and she agrees to be his wife.</p>\n<p>I haven’t read the other books in the <b>&lt;i&lt;Blades</b> series, and as best I could tell, that didn’t matter. This is a stand-alone story, has nothing to do with hockey, and didn’t seem to have any parts that needed a back-story to make sense. Several of the &lt;b&lt;i&lt;Blades books have been positively reviewed here at <b>AAR</b>; I’d hoped this too would be a good read. It wasn’t. It was, to steal a phrase from the book, “feckin rubbish.”</p>\n<p>The romance is first dry and then frustrating. Rory swaggers back into town, absolutely confident Erin still loves him — which she does, because as she says, “there’s a thin line between love and hate.” Rory woos Erin for several weeks, she “softens” toward him, forgives him, and then, after having screaming sex in his Range Rover, tells him, yes, yes, yes, she loves him. By the midpoint of the book, the two are back together, planning their wedding, and having as much unprotected sex as they can. (Birth control is never mentioned — it seems as though both now, and for the eight years they made love when they were younger, they never once worried about getting pregnant. This is especially annoying given that in <b>Breakaway</b>, Erin’s best friend Sandra, got knocked up by a loser the very first time she had sex and has since then had three more somewhat unwanted kids.)</p>\n<p>And it is the midpoint of the book, so despite the main conflict being solved —the hero won back the heroine — there are still 125 pages to go. For most of those pages, the focus is on the often unlikable, usually pitiable denizens of Ballycraig. We follow Sandra’s miserable marriage to the scumbag Larry, a wife abuser who buys his kids iPhones with money he makes selling drugs and root for her to find love with Jake. We watch as Jake, Rory’s ex-best mate, learns how to forgive Rory for dumping him too, and forces himself to realize Erin’s never going to love him because she’s always has and always will love Rory. We cringe as Bridget, Erin’s controlling mom, tries to force Erin to stay in Ballycraig by shooting down all of Erin’s dreams. We are supposed to laugh at the other Ballycraigians as they hang out in the town’s only pub, the Oak, where they drink too much, insult one another, and trash those different than they are. We hope for the best as Sandra’s four kids try and navigate their parents’ train wreck of a marriage and all the dead-end choices available to poor kids in a poor towns. And we see, in stark clarity, why both Rory and Erin wish to leave this depressing hamlet.</p>\n<p>In the book’s concluding chapters, Erin, whom I already found somewhat unlikable, behaves not once but twice in ways so stupid and irritating, I thought Rory should dump her again. In fact, I never really understood why Rory so loved Erin. Rory is portrayed as gorgeous, talented, kind (with the exception of the boorish way he broke up with Erin and dumped Jake), sexy, strong, ethical, and funny. He’s a bit on the cocky side, but his superiority is, in this book, proved time and time again. Everything he sets out do to, he does and does well. He’s even amazing in bed — and despite their four year separation, has only ever slept with two women other than Erin. Erin, on the other hand, is portrayed as a great friend to Sandra, formerly meek, but now pretty tough, and interested in art history. There’s nothing inherently compelling about her and it’s a mystery why both Rory and Jake — also a great, good-looking guy — are so obsessed with her.</p>\n<p>The relationship between Erin and Rory, for all their years together, seems a shallow one. Rory’s reasons for breaking up with Erin are described so briefly and there’s hardly any rationale given for why he decides he must have her back. I didn’t feel the emotional connection between the two, nor did I feel their physical one. The love scenes in this book which all occur in the second half &#8211; sex between the two isn’t even referred to until the end of the first third of the book — seemed almost clinical to me. There’s no heat in this book — Rory and Erin do have very satisfying sex together but it’s not written in a way that is erotic or arousing.</p>\n<p>I’ve read a fair number of books set in modern Ireland, and Ms. Martin’s Ballycraig, with its rundown housing estates, unemployed men who drink too much, and young people with depressingly limited futures, reads as real. It’s just not very pleasant. At one point, Jake challenges Rory to a drinking contest and everyone in the pub watches and eggs the two on. Rory, smarter and more mature than those around him, deliberately loses the contest and drinks only eight fast shots of whiskey to Jake’s uncounted but many more. The contest, as stupid as it is, is a tradition in the town and, sadly, the best entertainment to be had.</p>\n<p>I was relieved when I finished <b>Breakaway</b>.

Her husband was killed in a duel over what many believe was Georgie’s infidelity. She’s young, lovely, and after her year of mourning, desperate to regain her place in society. She’s too immature to live on her own — although under the law, she could — and yet she longs for the freedom she had while married. She wants a new husband, preferably one with a title and lots of money to buy the outrageous gowns for which she is known.</p>\n<p>Lord Dracy has neither money nor an impressive title. He abruptly left the naval life he loved when his fribble of a cousin, the previous Lord Dracy, died after bankrupting the family holdings. Dracy has come to Devon and is trying to raise funds to rebuild his estate. One of the only things his cousin left was a fast filly named Cartagena. Dracy brings Cartagena to Georgia’s father’s estate, Herne, to race her against the Earl of Hernscroft’s famous bay mare, Fancy Free. The race is winner takes all — whoever wins gets both horses. Dracy wants to win but not to gain Fancy Free. He plans to ask the Earl to instead give him one of the Earl’s stud horses, a prize breeder named Gosling-go. Dracy wins the race but, when he sits down to talk about the trade — the Earl really doesn’t want to part with Fancy Free — Dracy is distressed to find that earlier in the week, Gosling-go had to be put down. The Earl then offers Dracy a trade for a different filly: his daughter. If Darcy marries the young widow, he’ll get her portion of twelve thousand pounds, cash in hand, the day he weds her. As the Earl points out, Dracy could buy a herd of stallions with that kind of blunt.</p>\n<p>Dracy is shocked to hear the Earl’s proposal. The Earl points out that his daughter, who was wild when married (although faithful), is likely to return to her scandalous ways when she’s let loose on the ton again and would probably end up married to a “blackguard.” He’s looked into Dracy’s background, and feels Dracy is a trustworthy, solid man. The Earl laughs and says, “You’re the type she needs. A man of iron, used to command.” The Earl urges Dracy to take his offer; the Earl can keep his beloved horse, rid himself of a troublesome, scandalous daughter, and Dracy can wed and bed a gorgeous young girl and gain twelve thousand pounds.</p>\n<p>Georgia knows nothing of her father’s offer and Dracy is sure she will reject him if he tries to court her. For starters, the right side of his face is horribly scarred from an awful burn — it’s the sort of disfigurement that discomfits most. He’s also aware of Georgia’s reputation for extravagance and doubts a penniless ex-sailor would have any appeal to her. Because Georgia is a widow, despite her youth and the fact that she lives under her father’s roof, she theoretically can marry whomever she chooses. Dracy doubts she’ll choose him but, he agrees to come to dine at Herne that night.</p>\n<p>The two meet and Dracy is profoundly drawn to her beauty and her wit. She likes him but finds his ruined appearance hard to take. Furthermore, since she knows nothing of her father’s machinations, she doesn’t even think of him as a suitor for her. All she wants is to finally return to Town, snare a duke or two, and return to her carefree, feted life.</p>\n<p>She is shocked to be told by her father, the next morning, that she most certainly will not be heading back to London any time soon. She is to go with her mother to visit her sister Winnie and family in Hammersmith. Georgia is less than thrilled with this plan. She and Winnie have never gotten along. However, it is closer to London than Devon and her sister plans to hold a ball in Georgia’s honor to which the ton will be invited. Georgia and her mother head to her sister’s home and begin to send out invitations to the upcoming ball.</p>\n<p>Georgia is rather startled to see her mother address an invitation to Lord Dracy, who has come to Town to settle some affairs regarding his estate. Her mother tells her they can help Dracy make his way in society. Georgia doesn’t know why her mother would do such a thing for someone so much lower in social status, but assumes it has something to do with her father’s trying to talk Dracy out of taking away Fancy Free. Her mother tells her that Georgia will be allowed to go to London for the day if she takes Dracy as her escort and helps him purchase attire appropriate for the ball. Georgia agrees — thrilled to have a chance to go to Town &#8211; and vows to this time, “not let a trace of her unease about his disfigurement show.”</p>\n<p>Thus their courtship — of which she is unaware — starts. As Georgia begins what she believes will be a triumphant return to society, she is devastated to realize the scandal around her husband’s death still tars her. It’s clear, in fact, someone is working hard to not only keep the memory of duel very much alive in the minds of the ton but to make all believe Georgia instigated the duel by promising her jewels and her body to the man — since then vanished &#8211; who stabbed her husband through the heart. Georgia is young, self-absorbed, and enamored of her own beauty and is unprepared to handle the opprobrium she encounters at every turn. Thus, she turns again and again to Dracy to help her face the snubs, barbs, and venomous gossip she faces wherever she goes. She begins to rely on him, first to give her courage, and then to help her unmask whomever it is who continues to tarnish her reputation.</p>\n<p>Dracy wants her for his wife, so it works to his purposes to both be her comfort and her savior. He, and the reader, quickly figure out who the villain is, and with the help of Georgia’s very interesting brother Peregrine Perriam — I think he’s probably a spy — Dracy employs his considerable intellect to discerning how and why the villain engineered the duel and how his campaign of calumny may be stopped. This plot line is, at best, slightly engaging.</p>\n<p>The heart of the book is a slow and detailed exposition on Georgia’s changing feelings. Despite her marriage, she’s never known romantic love or passionate desire, and Dracy is determined to make her feel both for him. He woos her in every way he can. He’s not quite thirty but he is vastly more mature and experienced than she. Before his burn, he was a fine-looking man and learned much about the bodies and hearts of women in his travels. He lures her with kisses, with humor, and with his innate goodness. He is a lovely hero — he won’t marry her, despite her father’s offer, unless she not only loves him but believes she will be happy living with him in Devon in his rundown home, deprived of fancy gowns and London’s vibrant social scene. Georgia is so young and, in many ways, unformed. Dracy sees — more so than I could — the mature woman she could become.</p>\n<p>I liked their love story. I could say Dracy deserves better, but I feel sure he would disagree. He loves her. She is the wife he woos (at times, quite sexily), wants, and, works hard to win. Georgia is a lucky woman; and I was happy to see that, by the story’s end, she understands what a prize she has in Dracy. She comes quite late to wanting to marry him and her decision to do so seems almost capricious. Which, I suppose, it is. She is, after all, little more than a teen in this novel &#8211; it seems believable that one day, she just changes her mind.</p>\n<p>Ms. Beverley is an excellent writer and, in this book, she does a nice job of showing the society, upstairs and downstairs, in which her characters live. Those who enjoy their historicals to be rich in accurate period detail will relish this book.</p>\n",

He abruptly left the naval life he loved when his fribble of a cousin, the previous Lord Dracy, died after bankrupting the family holdings. Dracy has come to Devon and is trying to raise funds to rebuild his estate. One of the only things his cousin left was a fast filly named Cartagena. Dracy brings Cartagena to Georgia’s father’s estate, Herne, to race her against the Earl of Hernscroft’s famous bay mare, Fancy Free. The race is winner takes all — whoever wins gets both horses. Dracy wants to win but not to gain Fancy Free. He plans to ask the Earl to instead give him one of the Earl’s stud horses, a prize breeder named Gosling-go. Dracy wins the race but, when he sits down to talk about the trade — the Earl really doesn’t want to part with Fancy Free — Dracy is distressed to find that earlier in the week, Gosling-go had to be put down. The Earl then offers Dracy a trade for a different filly: his daughter. If Darcy marries the young widow, he’ll get her portion of twelve thousand pounds, cash in hand, the day he weds her. As the Earl points out, Dracy could buy a herd of stallions with that kind of blunt. Dracy is shocked to hear the Earl’s proposal. The Earl points out that his daughter, who was wild when married (although faithful), is likely to return to her scandalous ways when she’s let loose on the ton again and would probably end up married to a “blackguard.” He’s looked into Dracy’s background, and feels Dracy is a trustworthy, solid man. The Earl laughs and says, “You’re the type she needs. A man of iron, used to command.” The Earl urges Dracy to take his offer; the Earl can keep his beloved horse, rid himself of a troublesome, scandalous daughter, and Dracy can wed and bed a gorgeous young girl and gain twelve thousand pounds. Georgia knows nothing of her father’s offer and Dracy is sure she will reject him if he tries to court her. For starters, the right side of his face is horribly scarred from an awful burn — it’s the sort of disfigurement that discomfits most. He’s also aware of Georgia’s reputation for extravagance and doubts a penniless ex-sailor would have any appeal to her. Because Georgia is a widow, despite her youth and the fact that she lives under her father’s roof, she theoretically can marry whomever she chooses. Dracy doubts she’ll choose him but, he agrees to come to dine at Herne that night. The two meet and Dracy is profoundly drawn to her beauty and her wit. She likes him but finds his ruined appearance hard to take. Furthermore, since she knows nothing of her father’s machinations, she doesn’t even think of him as a suitor for her. All she wants is to finally return to Town, snare a duke or two, and return to her carefree, feted life. She is shocked to be told by her father, the next morning, that she most certainly will not be heading back to London any time soon. She is to go with her mother to visit her sister Winnie and family in Hammersmith. Georgia is less than thrilled with this plan. She and Winnie have never gotten along. However, it is closer to London than Devon and her sister plans to hold a ball in Georgia’s honor to which the ton will be invited. Georgia and her mother head to her sister’s home and begin to send out invitations to the upcoming ball. Georgia is rather startled to see her mother address an invitation to Lord Dracy, who has come to Town to settle some affairs regarding his estate. Her mother tells her they can help Dracy make his way in society. Georgia doesn’t know why her mother would do such a thing for someone so much lower in social status, but assumes it has something to do with her father’s trying to talk Dracy out of taking away Fancy Free. Her mother tells her that Georgia will be allowed to go to London for the day if she takes Dracy as her escort and helps him purchase attire appropriate for the ball. Georgia agrees — thrilled to have a chance to go to Town &#8211; and vows to this time, “not let a trace of her unease about his disfigurement show.” Thus their courtship — of which she is unaware — starts. As Georgia begins what she believes will be a triumphant return to society, she is devastated to realize the scandal around her husband’s death still tars her. It’s clear, in fact, someone is working hard to not only keep the memory of duel very much alive in the minds of the ton but to make all believe Georgia instigated the duel by promising her jewels and her body to the man — since then vanished &#8211; who stabbed her husband through the heart. Georgia is young, self-absorbed, and enamored of her own beauty and is unprepared to handle the opprobrium she encounters at every turn. Thus, she turns again and again to Dracy to help her face the snubs, barbs, and venomous gossip she faces wherever she goes. She begins to rely on him, first to give her courage, and then to help her unmask whomever it is who continues to tarnish her reputation. Dracy wants her for his wife, so it works to his purposes to both be her comfort and her savior. He, and the reader, quickly figure out who the villain is, and with the help of Georgia’s very interesting brother Peregrine Perriam — I think he’s probably a spy — Dracy employs his considerable intellect to discerning how and why the villain engineered the duel and how his campaign of calumny may be stopped. This plot line is, at best, slightly engaging. The heart of the book is a slow and detailed exposition on Georgia’s changing feelings. Despite her marriage, she’s never known romantic love or passionate desire, and Dracy is determined to make her feel both for him. He woos her in every way he can. He’s not quite thirty but he is vastly more mature and experienced than she. Before his burn, he was a fine-looking man and learned much about the bodies and hearts of women in his travels. He lures her with kisses, with humor, and with his innate goodness. He is a lovely hero — he won’t marry her, despite her father’s offer, unless she not only loves him but believes she will be happy living with him in Devon in his rundown home, deprived of fancy gowns and London’s vibrant social scene. Georgia is so young and, in many ways, unformed. Dracy sees — more so than I could — the mature woman she could become. I liked their love story. I could say Dracy deserves better, but I feel sure he would disagree. He loves her. She is the wife he woos (at times, quite sexily), wants, and, works hard to win. Georgia is a lucky woman; and I was happy to see that, by the story’s end, she understands what a prize she has in Dracy. She comes quite late to wanting to marry him and her decision to do so seems almost capricious. Which, I suppose, it is. She is, after all, little more than a teen in this novel &#8211; it seems believable that one day, she just changes her mind. Ms. Beverley is an excellent writer and, in this book, she does a nice job of showing the society, upstairs and downstairs, in which her characters live. Those who enjoy their historicals to be rich in accurate period detail will relish this book."

                "html": "<p>I can tell you what’s in a book, what I think works, and what doesn’t. It’s much harder to convey the experience of reading that same book. So let me say Elizabeth Essex’s <b>The Danger of Desire</b> has its strengths and flaws. It is also a transcendently pleasurable book to read. There is something distinctive and gorgeous about Ms. Essex’s writing — I really can’t think of any other writer whose prose is as languorously specific as hers. She’s become one of my very favorite writers; I’d looked forward to <b>The Danger of Desire</b> and it did not disappoint.</p>\n<p>Ms. Essex has thus far published three loosely linked books. In the first, <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/the-pursuit-of-pleasure/\"><b>The Pursuit of Pleasure</b></a>, she investigates the way secrets compromise love. In the second, <b>A Sense of Sin</b>, she illuminates how passion transforms its lovers. In <b>The Danger of Desire</b>, she plaits those two leitmotifs. This passionate love story between Meggs, a woman who trusts no one, and Hugh, the man who wants to know all of her &#8211; heart, body, and soul &#8211; is touching, riveting, and well-crafted.</p>\n<p>Meggs is, as she says, “a prime filching mort.” She hates being a thief, hates “the insidious cold, the incessant rain, the petty larceny — but hunger had a way of sorting out priorities.” Meggs steals because it was the only option for her — other than whoring &#8211; when she and her younger brother Timmy found themselves abandoned on the streets of London years ago. Meggs and Timmy are very good at what they do, and early one morning, they strip a watch and purse from an unsuspecting toff. Although the oblivious mark has no idea the pretty housemaid who bowls him over on Cockspur Street has just relieved him of his “portable chattels,” Naval Captain Hugh McAlden watches Meggs’s “smartly done” theft with &#8220;appreciation.”</p>\n<p>Hugh, currently recovering from a bad leg wound, wants nothing more than to regain his command of his ship, <i>Dangerous</i>. Hugh went to sea at age twelve; sixteen years later, it’s the life he craves. Vexingly, his injury has made him currently “not fit for command.” On the morning he sees Meggs, he’s just come from the Admiralty where his mentor, Admiral Middleton, offered him a job which, if successfully rendered, will lead to a knighthood for Hugh. The Admiralty Board has a traitor somewhere in its highest level, a treasonous spy sharing highly secret information with the French. The Admiral wants Hugh, within the space of two weeks, to “rout out this traitor and serve him up… trussed and ready for hanging.”</p>\n<p>Hugh leaves the meeting, catches Meggs in her act of deft larceny, and decides she is exactly what he needs — he’ll use a thief to catch a thief. He chases her through the London streets, and when he finally has her trapped in a dead-end lane, makes her an offer he thinks she can’t refuse. He tells her he’ll pay her a hundred pounds to steal for him. If she declines, he’ll turn her in to the law. She, suspicious, wary, and afraid, tosses her laundry basket at Hugh, kicks him hard in his wounded thigh, and runs away from him — and, as she does, steals his gold watch. As she escapes, however, she badly injures her hand vaulting over a wall topped with shards of broken glass. When her wound turns septic, she, unable to thieve and thus feed herself and Timmy, seeks out Hugh and agrees to take him up on his offer&#8230;for 750 pounds. Hugh, persuaded she’s perfect for his professional needs, agrees to her price. Meggs and Timmy move into Hugh’s home and she and Hugh begin to work together to identify and entrap the traitor.</p>\n<p>From the moment they meet, the two are attracted to each other. Hugh who “has been celibate for far too long,” is deeply drawn to Meggs. The first night she sleeps in his house, wrapped in blankets in front of his kitchen fire, he watches her sleep. He is almost shocked to realize that “all he wanted to do, all he craved, was to be able to touch her, this strange, unfathomable girl.” Meggs, who has never had any use for men, finds herself imagining Hugh in his bed: “A picture of him, etched across her brain, colors and all, lying on that bed, tawny and naked as the day was long, looking up at her with those pale, hawk bright eyes.” The sexual courtship between the two, written by Ms. Essex with elegant, intensely sensual prose, is a pleasure to read.</p>\n<p>When the two become lovers, Hugh feels his heart and body “align” for the first time in a very long time. He begins to imagine and then work to shape a shared future for himself, Meggs, and Timmy. Hugh’s dream, though, is not Meggs&#8217;s. She’s given Hugh her body and heart but is unwilling to give him the truth about her past. For Meggs, the day she stole her first purse, was the day she gave up any hope of a life with a man of Hugh’s class. It was also the day she determined she’d never trust anyone to care for her — the loss in Meggs’s past is so great, the pain of it prevents her from fully sharing herself with Hugh.</p>\n<p>I found Ms. Essex’s lovers compelling.

                "text": "I can tell you what’s in a book, what I think works, and what doesn’t. It’s much harder to convey the experience of reading that same book. So let me say Elizabeth Essex’s The Danger of Desire has its strengths and flaws. It is also a transcendently pleasurable book to read. There is something distinctive and gorgeous about Ms. Essex’s writing — I really can’t think of any other writer whose prose is as languorously specific as hers. She’s become one of my very favorite writers; I’d looked forward to The Danger of Desire and it did not disappoint. Ms. Essex has thus far published three loosely linked books. In the first, The Pursuit of Pleasure, she investigates the way secrets compromise love. In the second, A Sense of Sin, she illuminates how passion transforms its lovers. In The Danger of Desire, she plaits those two leitmotifs. This passionate love story between Meggs, a woman who trusts no one, and Hugh, the man who wants to know all of her &#8211; heart, body, and soul &#8211; is touching, riveting, and well-crafted. Meggs is, as she says, “a prime filching mort.” She hates being a thief, hates “the insidious cold, the incessant rain, the petty larceny — but hunger had a way of sorting out priorities.” Meggs steals because it was the only option for her — other than whoring &#8211; when she and her younger brother Timmy found themselves abandoned on the streets of London years ago.

I found <b>An Affair with Mr. Kennedy</b> a chore to read.</p>\n<p>The novel takes place in London in 1887, the year of Queen Victoria’s Golden Jubilee. Our hero, the thoroughly modern Zeno “Zak” Kennedy is a detective for Scotland Yard. The brilliant, clever, dedicated, athletic Zeno has a skill set so prodigious that, by the time he turned out to be a hell of a tenor with a facility for Italian opera, I abandoned any idea of seeing him as a plausible character. Zeno is a man with a mission; three years ago, a deadly bombing at King’s Cross left him missing a lover and unwaveringly determined to rid London of explosive-oriented anarchists. Currently, he’s got his eagle eye on a group of secretly seditious lords — he calls them the Bloody Four &#8211; who, Zeno believes, plan to explode a series of bombs in order to spark a violent Irish revolt which would then cause the House of Lords to vote against Irish Home Rule and thus create a possible path towards ultimate Irish independence.</p>\n<p>One of these aristocrats, Gerald St. Clair, happens to be the brother-in-law of an impossibly gorgeous young widow, Cassandra St. Clare. The Yard wonders if Cassandra, who is also connected to another of the possible Bloody Four, the odious Lord Delamere, could be a part of the Fenian plot. Cassandra, conveniently, just moved into a townhouse in Belgravia owned by Zak which is (sigh) adjacent to his. Super sexy Cassandra, after a brief and constraining marriage, is living a rather outré life. She is an (extraordinarily talented) artist (her uber-progressive parents sent her to Paris to study when she was just seventeen where she drank, painted, and got a tattoo), rides a bicycle, lives on her own, and once she sees her fine-looking landlord, takes a lover with ease.</p>\n<p>Zak and Cassie begin a passionate affair despite Zak’s lack of transparency about his initial interest in her. The two can’t get enough of each other, which was inopportune; I’d had enough of them as a couple by the hundredth page. Ms. Stone’s sexual prose is clunky; her descriptions of the bawdy shenanigans between Cassie and Zak veer from awkward to icky. Zak has “a brute of a penis.” Cassie, the morning after the two have first made love, as her maid Cecile serves the naked lovers breakfast in bed describes him (in French) to as “frightfully large and as hard as a Bengal tiger.” In one of many overwrought love scenes, Zak makes love to Cassie with his “throbbing shaft” as she murmurs “musical and mysterious female whispers and growls.”</p>\n<p>Cassie and Zak, when not engaged in erotic activities, pursue the Bloody Four. I give Ms. Stone full credit for creating a complex plot; I liked the suspense component of this novel more than its romance. The book is full of well-researched facts about Impressionism, explosives, Scotland Yard, late nineteenth century condoms, and the “Irish question.” Still, Ms. Stone takes far too long to resolve her mystery and her storytelling is inconsistently paced, at times excruciatingly slow and at times oddly rushed. The suspense conclusion is a good one, but given that I found myself skimming the last half of the book, it had less resonance for me than perhaps it should.</p>\n<p>It’s clear that Cassie and Zak are supposed to be modern, progressive Victorians.

The premise and setting of this series are enticing — historical romance desperately needs stories other than those about the lords and ladies of the Regency era.

                "html": "<p>Over a rainy post-holiday weekend, I read &#8211; back to back &#8211; Courtney Milan’s <b><i>Turner</i></b> series. The series comprises three books and a novella and tells the tale, novella excepted, of the three Turner brothers, Ash (<b>Unveiled</b>), Mark (<b>Unclaimed</b>), and Smite, the hero of this novel. I found the series irresistible — taken together the books present an entrancing experience greater than that found in reading each alone. My favorite of the three is the first, <b>Unveiled</b>; my second, this tale of Smite and his unconventional love, Miranda Darling.</p>\n<p>Each Turner is, in some way, an oddity. Ash is an Earl with no formal education and an inability to read; Mark, a ton darling who’s known for his treatise on and embracement of chastity; Smite, a wealthy magistrate who shuns all material and creature comforts. The three men are each acutely scarred by a childhood spent at the hands of a mother whose religious fervor devolved first into insane abuse, then into horrifying abandonment. These are books that must be read as a piece &#8211; <b>Unraveled</b> is firmly grounded in the brothers’ evolving relationships with one another and with Richard Dalrymple, once Smite’s closest friend and the brother of Margaret, Ash’s wife.</p>\n<p>Ash and Mark have each found love, but, the Smite encountered in the previous books in the series seemed an unlikely candidate for intimacy. Smite is only a tad close to one person, his younger brother Mark. His relationship with Ash is strained, he lives alone with no servants, and his colleagues and those at his mercy in court see him as a zealot. He is known, unflatteringly, throughout Bristol as “Lord Justice.” Smite would be a completely solitary creature were it not for Ghost, an endearing sheepdog foisted on him by Mark. In general — there is the occasional meaningless coupling — Smite neither intimately touches nor talks to anyone.</p>\n<p>One day he sees a young woman in his court. Smite, who has an eidetic memory, recognizes her despite the disguise she’s assumed; he’s seen her in his court before, testifying. Realizing, were she to swear to anything under oath, she’d be guilty of perjury, he dismisses the case before she can speak and, once the session is ended, goes in search of her. Once he finds her, he tells her to stay out of his court or next time, she’ll find herself Australia bound or worse.</p>\n<p>Staying out of the courts is a problem for Miss Miranda Darling. Miranda, the orphaned daughter of a pair of traveling players, lives in the slums of Bristol in Temple Parish. Those who live in Temple Parish rely not on the King’s edict for their safety and laws, but on the Patron. Miranda, in order to protect herself and her ward Robbie, does the Patron one favor a month in exchange for her and Robbie’s safety. Miranda’s theatrical background pooled with her charm makes her an ideal candidate to play roles for the Patron. A role she’s played several times is that of an innocent young lady testifying on the part of someone the Patron wants found not guilty. When Smite bans Miranda, in all her false incarnations, from the Bristol courts, Miranda worries the Patron will be displeased with her. When she tells the Patron, whose face is hidden away on the other side of an old confessional booth in a no longer used church, of Smite’s decree, the Patron tells her she’s to continue to seek out Lord Justice.</p>\n<p>Miranda and Smite encounter each other again, Smite follows Miranda home, and after a few days of thinking about how much she unsettles him and how deeply he wants her, he asks her to become his mistress. She, equally drawn to him, says yes. I found myself bewildered.</p>\n<p>It’s not I didn’t believe that Smite and Miranda were strongly attracted to one another. Ms. Milan writes well about desire and passion and in this book, as in all the <b><i>Turner</i></b> tales, the lovers’ want for each other is credible and carnal. What I struggled with was the speed and casualness with which they acted on their desire.</p>\n<p>Prior to meeting Miranda, Smite, as an adult, has never had a true romantic relationship or even close amative friendship with anyone, male or female. He shares nothing of himself with anyone, not even Mark. And yet within days of meeting Miranda, not only is he making love to her constantly — much of the middle third of the book is spent detailing the numerous libidinous couplings between the two — he’s telling her his secrets and his history. For her part, Miranda is a virgin who, in an early chapter, smacks Robbie across the cheek for suggesting she’d ever sell herself. Yet when Smite tells her, after they share a couple of soul searing kisses, he’ll pay her a thousand pounds to be in his bed for a month, she says yes instantly. The two go from strangers to soul mates so quickly that, as much as I enjoyed their relationship, I didn’t find it persuasive.</p>\n<p>Despite this, the book is quite appealing. Ms. Milan writes excellent dialogue and superior steamy sex scenes. Her plot, which revolves around the identity of the Patron, is a fine one. She shows us, through her characters’ eyes, why a fair and impartial legal system for all — and not just the wealthy as was the norm in 19th century England — is necessary. The powerful discord between Smite and Richard Dalrymple is explained and resolved in a canny and compassionate way. Even the epilogue, a plot device I usually deplore, is used to good effect here.</p>\n<p>So, yes, read <b>Unraveled</b>… after you’ve read <b>Unveiled</b>, <b>Unclaimed</b>, and <b>Unlocked</b>. The <b><i>Turner</i></b> books <i>en masse</i> are a real treat. Taken on its own, <b>Unraveled</b> is a flawed but fun read.</p>\n",

Miranda’s theatrical background pooled with her charm makes her an ideal candidate to play roles for the Patron. A role she’s played several times is that of an innocent young lady testifying on the part of someone the Patron wants found not guilty. When Smite bans Miranda, in all her false incarnations, from the Bristol courts, Miranda worries the Patron will be displeased with her. When she tells the Patron, whose face is hidden away on the other side of an old confessional booth in a no longer used church, of Smite’s decree, the Patron tells her she’s to continue to seek out Lord Justice. Miranda and Smite encounter each other again, Smite follows Miranda home, and after a few days of thinking about how much she unsettles him and how deeply he wants her, he asks her to become his mistress. She, equally drawn to him, says yes. I found myself bewildered. It’s not I didn’t believe that Smite and Miranda were strongly attracted to one another. Ms. Milan writes well about desire and passion and in this book, as in all the Turner tales, the lovers’ want for each other is credible and carnal. What I struggled with was the speed and casualness with which they acted on their desire. Prior to meeting Miranda, Smite, as an adult, has never had a true romantic relationship or even close amative friendship with anyone, male or female. He shares nothing of himself with anyone, not even Mark. And yet within days of meeting Miranda, not only is he making love to her constantly — much of the middle third of the book is spent detailing the numerous libidinous couplings between the two — he’s telling her his secrets and his history. For her part, Miranda is a virgin who, in an early chapter, smacks Robbie across the cheek for suggesting she’d ever sell herself. Yet when Smite tells her, after they share a couple of soul searing kisses, he’ll pay her a thousand pounds to be in his bed for a month, she says yes instantly. The two go from strangers to soul mates so quickly that, as much as I enjoyed their relationship, I didn’t find it persuasive. Despite this, the book is quite appealing. Ms. Milan writes excellent dialogue and superior steamy sex scenes. Her plot, which revolves around the identity of the Patron, is a fine one. She shows us, through her characters’ eyes, why a fair and impartial legal system for all — and not just the wealthy as was the norm in 19th century England — is necessary. The powerful discord between Smite and Richard Dalrymple is explained and resolved in a canny and compassionate way. Even the epilogue, a plot device I usually deplore, is used to good effect here. So, yes, read Unraveled… after you’ve read Unveiled, Unclaimed, and Unlocked. The Turner books en masse are a real treat. Taken on its own, Unraveled is a flawed but fun read."

Both the heroine, repressed Martha, and the hero, feckless Theo, are, by this novel’s end, alert to possibilities unimaginable to both prior to their relationship. In <b>A Lady Awakened</b>, opposites don’t merely attract; two strongly disparate people are transformed into a singular pair.</p>\n<p>Martha Russell is twenty-one, childless, and recently freed by a riding accident from an unhappy marriage to a drunkard. She is prepared to leave the home in which she’s lived for the past year, her husband’s family seat, Seaton Park, and dutifully move in with one of her married siblings when she discovers her husband&#8217;s heir is a selfish lech who, in the past, molested the female staff at Seaton Park. When the family solicitor points out the inheritance isn’t settled until it’s clear Martha’s not pregnant, Martha, a woman so virtuous it’s wearing, begins to think of defrauding her seedy brother-in-law out of the estate.</p>\n<p>Martha decides to approach Theophilus (Theo) Mirkwood, a young man recently moved into the estate next door. Theo has been sent to rusticate in the country by his father who is justifiably concerned at Theo’s careless, irresponsible life in London. As Theo explains, the crowning blow was Theo’s “expenditure of two months’ allowance to buy a single snuff box from Sèvres&#8221; which, he acknowledges, was “Wasteful, in fact, and foolish in the extreme. Particularly given that I don’t use snuff.” Martha offers to pay Theo to bed her; the two will have sex every afternoon until it’s clear she has or hasn’t conceived.</p>\n<p>Theo, after a bit of thought and a peek or two down Martha’s bodice, says yes. He sees the offer as a way to have safe sex with a pretty young widow and, though he’s the heir to a fortune, his funds are currently low. He’s unconcerned about his part in the fraud — this, like most things, Theo sees as not his problem. Martha suggests the two begin immediately — time is of the essence literally here — and their relationship begins.</p>\n<p>I’ve rarely read a more uncomfortable encounter than the first between Theo and Martha &#8211; or, as Martha insists, Mrs. Russell and Mr. Mirkwood. Martha loathes sex, intimacy, seduction, and at first, Theo. She envisions a month of lying perfectly still, suffering through Theo’s distasteful and, she hopes, hurried thrusts. Theo, on the other hand, is a sensualist. He adores sex, women’s glorious naked bodies, and casual easy intimacy. Thus, once he realizes Martha’s intent to render sex into unpleasant duty, he can barely perform. It’s only by —and this is character development genius on the part of Ms. Grant — imagining Martha as an engaged, passionate participant in bed, can he deliver “the first installment of her purchase.”</p>\n<p>The next afternoons are no better. Theo tries to woo Martha by telling her how lovely she is. Martha finds these declarations repugnant. Theo attempts to coax passion out of her body. Martha shrinks away from even a kiss. The sex, for the first week they are together, is awful.</p>\n<p>However, the two do more in bed than toil. They talk and, slowly, begin to learn first about, then from one another. What seems in Martha to be dull morality shows itself to Theo — and to the reader — as a powerful, even engaging desire to improve the lives of the poor. Theo’s casual approach to life hides a fine mind and, once he sees the destitution of those who live on his and Martha’s lands, Theo begins to apply himself to improve a world he’d never before noticed. Their conversations turn into collaborations and, within a few weeks of knowing each other, the two are working together to care for their lands and tenants. And, of course, their connection outside the bedroom begins to shape the one within.</p>\n<p>I’ve read other books with this same basic plot — heroine needs baby fast, finds jaded hero, hero and heroine discover love in the midst of their passion — and yet <b>A Lady Awakened</b> feels entirely new. Martha and Theo are imaginatively unique and their relationship develops in unexpected ways. Theirs is the best of love affairs, one that enriches every aspect of their lives.</p>\n<p>Ms. Grant does so much well in this book. All the secondary characters and the temporal and geographical context are conveyed beautifully. She describes the harsh lives of the poor in early 19th century England, while still giving those lives touches of joy and care. The concerns that motivate first Martha and then Theo are illustrated by example rather than by description. Just as Theo’s wonderful land steward, Mr. Granville, guides Theo to see how pernicious poverty can be, so Ms. Grant, by limning the lives of the servants and tenants in <b>A Lady Awakened</b>, subtly guides the reader.</p>\n<p>She’s also a remarkable and able writer. Her prose is capable, strong, and clear. When Theo and Martha finally truly come together in bed, afterwards, lying in Martha’s arms, Theo is “a gimcrack shell of a man, dumb elation rattling about where his lungs and liver ought to be.” When the two are unable to arrive upon a shared vision of their future, Theo sees their state as one in which “He’d cleaved his cares from hers.” An ordinary experience such as this one, where Martha moves from sitting in the first pew at church into a seat at in third row, is acutely rendered:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“One saw things differently from the third row.

The household staff at Seaton Hall is somewhat unrealistically in perfect sympathy with Martha and, even less likely, with each other.

From the moment fabulously wealthy, divinely handsome, sexually exceptional, linguistically prodigal, superb rider, and almost painfully well-endowed Alec Munro, the Earl of Dalgliesh, sees flame haired, multi-orgasmic, violet-eyed, lush breasted, well-traveled, lynx fur coat wearing Zelda Mackenzie, he wants to ravish her in every position possible. She feels the same way about him, and after several dull chapters where the two talk about how desperately and creatively they want to get down and dirty with each other, by page seventy, they’ve had (literally) unbelievable amounts of constant copious coitus and Zelda has fallen in love. Alec, who’s married to a super bitch, isn’t quite in love but he wants much much more of Zelda’s curves and crevices, so the two embark on an affair. Alec’s slutty psycho wife tries to first break them up and then kill them. Alec, when he’s not drinking half a bottle of whiskey for lunch or showing Zelda the joys of bondage with very special knots, works on making vast sums of money from his mines in South Africa and valiantly protecting his step-son from his nasty mom.</p>\n<p>I didn’t like the characters. Alec is my least favorite kind of alpha-male hero. He’s screwed more women than he can remember, but even thinking about the other lovers who taught Zelda to be so bodacious in bed makes him want to hit her. He’s so cock-sure of himself that, when Zelda compliments his amorous abilities, he thinks to himself, “That’s what they all say.” He lies repeatedly to Zelda — sometimes to shut her up, other times to manipulate her into doing his will. He’s such a dick — in so many offensive ways — I kept hoping he’d suddenly be felled by some horrible, impotence-inducing disease. Zelda is no better. She’s a whiner, wails when she doesn’t get her twentieth big bang of the day, and constantly discounts the needs, schedules, and presence of others so she can have wild screaming sex anywhere, anytime with Alec. Violetta, Alec’s evil wife, is so over the top, she’s a caricature. She doesn’t have a single redeeming aspect to her — she makes Cruella DeVil look compassionate.</p>\n<p>I didn’t like the historical back story. Ms. Johnson clearly knows her time and place but, in <b>Seductive as Flame</b>, the history doesn’t enhance the story. Furthermore, Alec is uber-wealthy and much of the history centers on his efforts to become even wealthier. I didn’t care about his African mines, his sumptuous travels all over the world, or his near miraculous ability to procure fantastically singular and prohibitively expensive gifts for Zelda at a moment&#8217;s notice. In good historical fiction, it’s not enough that context is detailed and accurate; it must also be interesting. In this book, it is not.</p>\n<p>I didn’t like the sex and there was loads of sex. In all of it, Alec is the Zen master of orgasm. Zelda comes over and over again while Alec, smarmily congratulating himself on his dick size and stamina, doesn’t until he so chooses. He does choose to come in Zelda and rather cavalierly justified this by first saying he can’t help himself — funny how that Zen thing comes and goes — and then saying, no matter what, he has to have her as his. Alec and Zelda often use bickering and hostility as foreplay and, given that none of it is witty, funny, or appealing, their verbal intercourse debases their sexual intercourse.

Nor is it — and this is part of my discontent — the tale of an Eversea or a Redmond, the two families whose lives and loves have been chronicled in the series’ first five books.</p>\n<p>The heroine of <b>How the Marquess Was Won</b> is Miss Phoebe Vale, a forthright young woman who is a teacher at Miss Marietta Endicott’s Academy for Girls. Phoebe, born in the slums of London, has secured her place in life by dint of will and intelligence. At twenty-two, she’s unmarried and feels rather uncomfortably on the proverbial shelf. Phoebe has a vibrant, enthusiastic imagination — fueled in part by the broadsheets she loves. She knows that while she may be lowly born, her aspirations are as valid as anyone’s. She appreciates the stability Endicott’s Academy has brought her — she arrived there at age ten, swept off the streets of Seven Dials by a mysterious benefactor — but she wants more. As the book begins, Phoebe is contemplating saying yes to two opportunities, one which would take her to Africa to teach, and the other, a short-term affair (just two days), which entails being a chaperone to former student Lisbeth Redmond, the niece of Fanchette and Isaiah Redmond.</p>\n<p>Lisbeth, is at twenty, a diamond of the first, albeit shallow, water. She will make the perfect wife for any lord and, the hero, Julian Spenser, Marquess Dryden, is known for his perfection.

His father was a reprobate who gambled away the family’s wealth and property. Julian has gotten it all back, whilst earning the slavish devotion of the ton &#8211; all but one last piece of land. That bit of English countryside, currently owned by Isaiah Redmond, will be Julian’s when he marries the lovely Lisbeth.</p>\n<p>The plot here is well-executed and as conventional as it seems. Julian, as full of himself as any hero could be without being completely intolerable, falls for Phoebe and yet can’t conceive of her as more than a mistress. Phoebe, of course, refuses to settle for such a lessened life. Julian courts the elegantly cruel Lisbeth even as he works ardently to get Phoebe in his bed. A happy ending for the lovers seems not possible, and yet we readers know that love will find its way, helped along by Phoebe’s formidable feline Charybdis.</p>\n<p>I wasn’t bothered by the routine plot. Ms. Long is justly known for creating undeniable individuals and she does so in <b>How the Marquess Was Won</b> (although in this book, the portrayals of the ladies and lords buzzing about the lovers are unusually flat). But the leads, Phoebe and Julian, are nuanced characters. As in all of the <b><i>Pennyroyal Green</i></b> books, Ms. Long uncovers, layer by layer, the true selves underneath the images her protagonists present to the world. Love, in these books, is antithetical to the social definition — the class definition — of perfection.

Ms. Long has deliberately placed — and paced — tidbits of information, clues really, in the earlier books in the series.

                "html": "<p>Alex MacDonald, the Scots hero of Margaret Mallory’s <b>The Sinner</b>, has every attribute one could dream up for the perfect alpha male hero. He’s a “blindingly handsome” golden haired sex god with a killer wit and a deadly claymore. He can easily defeat, single handedly, groups of ferocious warriors and, still dripping his enemies’ blood, kiss a chieftain’s gorgeous daughter witless. He’s intensely loyal, skilled with children, and has a perfect “arse.” His only blemish: a profound resistance to matrimony born from years of watching his parents’ carriage-wreck of a marriage.</p>\n<p>This aversion to matrimony is shared by the novel’s heroine, Glynnis MacNeil. Glynnis has already been married once to a slopsucker of a man whom she stabbed in the thigh — she missed — then deserted. (Under Highland law, a spouse has the right to leave within the first year of the marriage for any reason.) Unfortunately for Glynnis, neither her father, the Chieftain of the MacNeil clan, nor her ex-husband is pleased with her response to her first round of nuptial non-bliss. Her derelict husband Magnus would like to kill her — or just settle for letting his men rape her repeatedly — and her father adamantly insists she marry again.</p>\n<p><b>The Sinner</b> is the second book in Ms. Mallory’s series <b><i>Return of the Highlanders</i></b> and, like the first, <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/the-guardian-margaret-mallory/\"><b>The Guardian</b></a>, much of the plot revolves around the MacDonald Clan and its efforts to preserve itself amidst the political turmoil of early 1500’s Highlands Scotland. Alex and his friends Duncan and Ian (the hero of <b>The Guardian</b>) all are sworn to serve their cousin Connor, the head of the MacDonald clan. Alex would do anything for Connor <b><i>except</i></b> wed a lass from another clan in order to form a political alliance. Given that Alex won’t do the one thing Connor really needs him to do, Connor consigns Alex another charge. Alex is to travel to Edinburgh to meet with Sabine, a French noblewoman who was once Alex’s lover. Sabine has written Alex with the message that she has a special gift for him. Alex and Connor believe the mysterious gift may have something to do with the rebellion fomented by many clans from the Western Isles against the Scottish Crown. The MacDonald Clan is walking a fine line by supporting neither the rebellion nor the Crown. Connor and Alex wonder if Sabine — or their mutual French friend D’Arcy &#8211; has information for them regarding the views of the current regent, the Duke of Albany, on the stance the MacDonald Clan has taken.</p>\n<p>Alex and Duncan head to Edinburgh by way of Duart Castle on the island of Mull, the seat of the Maclean clan, where many of the leaders of the rebellious clans are meeting. (I remain in the dark about why the two went there — Alex asks Duncan why they’re making this detour and Duncan just whistles a sad song.) Glynnis is there with her father whom she is trying to convince not to join the rebellion or force her to marry one of the chieftains there. Magnus is there too and, when he attacks Glynnis, Alex fights him almost to the death — Alex of course wins — while Glynnis watches and tries not to faint with desire. Later that day, after accidentally seeing Alex in all his astonishingly splendid naked male glory, Glynnis asks Alex to meet her behind the kitchens at midnight where she asks if he’ll take her to Edinburgh. She’s decided to run away from her match-making father and move in with her dead mother’s family whom she’s never met. (I’m sure this has nothing to do with wishing to see more of Alex’s perfect arse.) When Alex tells her no, she threatens to tell Shaggy Maclean, the chieftain of Duart, she saw Alex swiving Catherine, Shaggy’s routinely unfaithful wife. Alex, who <b><i>this</i></b> time had turned down Catherine’s offer of afternoon delight, reluctantly agrees to take Glynnis with him.</p>\n<p>The two, along with Duncan and their men, escape Duart Castle and the adventure begins. The plot in this book borders on Byzantine. By the time Glynnis and Alex make it to Edinburgh — just a third of the way through the book &#8211; they have left Duncan and the others, survived many a deadly escapade, and become ardently passionate lovers. As is often the case in romance novels, lust is a gateway drug for love, and soon the pair begins to consider wedding rather than merely commitment-free bedding.</p>\n<p><b>The Sinner</b> is a fun but flawed read. Alex, although a little too perfect for my tastes, is a lovely man inside and out. He’s been raised to believe he’s not capable of fidelity and yet, from the moment he meets Glynnis, he’s as true a lover as any woman could want. Thus it’s awfully annoying that Glynnis spends much of their time together telling herself and Alex she’s sure he’ll be unfaithful. Ms. Mallory foreshadows Glynnis’ behavior so heavily I began to be afraid to turn the pages, sure I’d be chagrined by predictable melodramatic mayhem and, indeed, I was. The moment Glynnis sees Alex doing something she doesn’t understand, she is vehemently sure he’s betrayed her. Glynnis’ instant error in judgment does grave wrong to Alex and makes her seem emotionally stunted.</p>\n<p>It’s a shame Ms. Mallory felt the need to add this facet to Glynnis and her romance with Alex. Had I not been so disappointed by Glynnis’s self-indulgent lack of faith in Alex’s love, I’d have liked her, and the book, much more. Ms. Mallory knows how to spin a good yarn and <b>The Sinner</b> has great secondary characters, sweetly steamy sex scenes, excellent ambiance, an interesting if too complicated plot, and many a genuinely moving moment. I wish Ms. Mallory would free her heroines from needless histrionics in their relationships. This book and the first in the <b><i>Return of the Highlanders</i></b> series both have heroines that wreak unnecessary havoc because they don’t trust the love their true-hearted Highlanders have lavished upon them. Despite this failing, I&#8217;m looking forward to the next book in the series, <b>The Warrior</b>, which will tell Duncan’s story. I’m hopeful he’ll fall for a lass whose heart is as large as the oft-mentioned marvels Scotsmen keep hidden under their plaids.</p>\n",

Glynnis is there with her father whom she is trying to convince not to join the rebellion or force her to marry one of the chieftains there. Magnus is there too and, when he attacks Glynnis, Alex fights him almost to the death — Alex of course wins — while Glynnis watches and tries not to faint with desire. Later that day, after accidentally seeing Alex in all his astonishingly splendid naked male glory, Glynnis asks Alex to meet her behind the kitchens at midnight where she asks if he’ll take her to Edinburgh. She’s decided to run away from her match-making father and move in with her dead mother’s family whom she’s never met. (I’m sure this has nothing to do with wishing to see more of Alex’s perfect arse.) When Alex tells her no, she threatens to tell Shaggy Maclean, the chieftain of Duart, she saw Alex swiving Catherine, Shaggy’s routinely unfaithful wife. Alex, who this time had turned down Catherine’s offer of afternoon delight, reluctantly agrees to take Glynnis with him. The two, along with Duncan and their men, escape Duart Castle and the adventure begins. The plot in this book borders on Byzantine. By the time Glynnis and Alex make it to Edinburgh — just a third of the way through the book &#8211; they have left Duncan and the others, survived many a deadly escapade, and become ardently passionate lovers. As is often the case in romance novels, lust is a gateway drug for love, and soon the pair begins to consider wedding rather than merely commitment-free bedding. The Sinner is a fun but flawed read. Alex, although a little too perfect for my tastes, is a lovely man inside and out. He’s been raised to believe he’s not capable of fidelity and yet, from the moment he meets Glynnis, he’s as true a lover as any woman could want. Thus it’s awfully annoying that Glynnis spends much of their time together telling herself and Alex she’s sure he’ll be unfaithful. Ms. Mallory foreshadows Glynnis’ behavior so heavily I began to be afraid to turn the pages, sure I’d be chagrined by predictable melodramatic mayhem and, indeed, I was. The moment Glynnis sees Alex doing something she doesn’t understand, she is vehemently sure he’s betrayed her. Glynnis’ instant error in judgment does grave wrong to Alex and makes her seem emotionally stunted. It’s a shame Ms. Mallory felt the need to add this facet to Glynnis and her romance with Alex. Had I not been so disappointed by Glynnis’s self-indulgent lack of faith in Alex’s love, I’d have liked her, and the book, much more. Ms. Mallory knows how to spin a good yarn and The Sinner has great secondary characters, sweetly steamy sex scenes, excellent ambiance, an interesting if too complicated plot, and many a genuinely moving moment. I wish Ms. Mallory would free her heroines from needless histrionics in their relationships. This book and the first in the Return of the Highlanders series both have heroines that wreak unnecessary havoc because they don’t trust the love their true-hearted Highlanders have lavished upon them. Despite this failing, I&#8217;m looking forward to the next book in the series, The Warrior, which will tell Duncan’s story. I’m hopeful he’ll fall for a lass whose heart is as large as the oft-mentioned marvels Scotsmen keep hidden under their plaids."

He&#8217;s come to see her brother and his friend, the war wounded Fergus, whom Gordon hasn&#8217;t seen in six months, since both men returned from India. Shona, Fergus, and her companion Helen are all about to be evicted from their home &#8211; her husband&#8217;s heir is taking the house. Shona&#8217;s husband left her destitute and now, having sold everything she owns to pay off his debts and support her small family, she has nowhere to turn.</p>\n<p>Shona and Gordon still love one another, but for hazy reasons neither can embrace the other. As Gordon is leaving, he stiffly inquires if Fergus needs anything and Shona, desperate, asks if Gordon can offer her brother a home in Inverness. She lies to Gordon about her distressed circumstances and tells him she&#8217;s having a new house in Inverness readied and thus will be able to take Fergus back in a few weeks. Gordon agrees to take Fergus and Shona and Gordon part, full of thoughts of their passionate, rolling in the heather youthful love.</p>\n<p>Once Gordon picks up Fergus, Helen and Shona travel to the last piece of property she and Fergus have claim to, a moldering castle in Invergaire Glen called Gairloch. Against Fergus&#8217;s wishes &#8211; Shona has kept in him the dark about how dire their financial straits are &#8211; Shona plans to sell Gairloch to wealthy Americans. Gairloch just happens to be next door to Rathmhor, the house in which Gordon grew up and now owns. And guess what? Gordon wasn&#8217;t planning to settle in Inverness; he too, has headed back to the place of their childhoods.</p>\n<p>Once Gordon and Shona are both back in Invergaire Glen they begin a tedious courtship. The big misunderstanding in their past could be cleared up in a few words, were the two to sit down over tea. Additionally, they say so little to each other in the present; they are constantly, unnecessarily, at odds. The course of their love does not run smooth. Shona is exceptionally proud and ridiculously coy; by chapter nine, I didn’t care if she found True Love — again — or not.</p>\n<p>Gordon, although overly reticent, is a more appealing person and is interesting apart from his affair with Shona. He’s turned his back on war and is focused on developing a better explosive for mining. Here, in the historical piece of her historical romance, Ms. Ranney shines. I thoroughly enjoyed learning about the development of nitroglycerine and the role that science played in improving both armaments and the Scottish economy in the second half of the 19th century.</p>\n<p>But the history is one small pleasant piece in what is a mess of a book. Ms. Ranney’s plotlines, characters (alive and dead), and relationships are crammed together, often in confusing order, and few of them are dealt with satisfactorily. I found it trying to follow the unhappy murderous marriage from the past, several (possible) ghosts, the wartime love affair between Fergus and the nurse accompanying the Loftons (the stereotypically ugly Americans who arrive at Gairloch and refuse to leave), Gordon’s unhappy childhood, Shona’s unfulfilling marriage, <b><i>and</i></b> the proper way to throw a Highland dance. By the novel’s end, I needed a quiet bath and a glass of wine.</p>\n<p>Ms. Ranney is a good wordsmith and her love for Scotland, its peoples, and past is patent and persuasive. In several of her earlier books, I have been impressed with the diligent research undergirding her tales. But in <b>A Scottish Love</b>, her well done prose and stellar historical study are swamped by too much clutter. Add to that a bitchy heroine, and I have to say, I didn’t love (or even enjoy) <b>A Scottish Love</b>.</p>\n",

Gordon agrees to take Fergus and Shona and Gordon part, full of thoughts of their passionate, rolling in the heather youthful love. Once Gordon picks up Fergus, Helen and Shona travel to the last piece of property she and Fergus have claim to, a moldering castle in Invergaire Glen called Gairloch. Against Fergus&#8217;s wishes &#8211; Shona has kept in him the dark about how dire their financial straits are &#8211; Shona plans to sell Gairloch to wealthy Americans. Gairloch just happens to be next door to Rathmhor, the house in which Gordon grew up and now owns. And guess what? Gordon wasn&#8217;t planning to settle in Inverness; he too, has headed back to the place of their childhoods. Once Gordon and Shona are both back in Invergaire Glen they begin a tedious courtship. The big misunderstanding in their past could be cleared up in a few words, were the two to sit down over tea. Additionally, they say so little to each other in the present; they are constantly, unnecessarily, at odds. The course of their love does not run smooth. Shona is exceptionally proud and ridiculously coy; by chapter nine, I didn’t care if she found True Love — again — or not. Gordon, although overly reticent, is a more appealing person and is interesting apart from his affair with Shona. He’s turned his back on war and is focused on developing a better explosive for mining. Here, in the historical piece of her historical romance, Ms. Ranney shines. I thoroughly enjoyed learning about the development of nitroglycerine and the role that science played in improving both armaments and the Scottish economy in the second half of the 19th century. But the history is one small pleasant piece in what is a mess of a book. Ms. Ranney’s plotlines, characters (alive and dead), and relationships are crammed together, often in confusing order, and few of them are dealt with satisfactorily. I found it trying to follow the unhappy murderous marriage from the past, several (possible) ghosts, the wartime love affair between Fergus and the nurse accompanying the Loftons (the stereotypically ugly Americans who arrive at Gairloch and refuse to leave), Gordon’s unhappy childhood, Shona’s unfulfilling marriage, and the proper way to throw a Highland dance. By the novel’s end, I needed a quiet bath and a glass of wine. Ms. Ranney is a good wordsmith and her love for Scotland, its peoples, and past is patent and persuasive. In several of her earlier books, I have been impressed with the diligent research undergirding her tales. But in A Scottish Love, her well done prose and stellar historical study are swamped by too much clutter. Add to that a bitchy heroine, and I have to say, I didn’t love (or even enjoy) A Scottish Love."

                "html": "<p>Ms. Jeffries’ latest in her <b><i>Hellions of Halstead Hall</i></b> series begins inauspiciously with an odd letter to readers from a character in the novel — the grandmother of the hellacious Sharpe siblings. In it, Hetty Plumtree frets about her grandson Gabriel&#8217;s willful ways, speculates about his feelings for Virginia Waverly (the sister of Gabriel’s dead best friend), and confesses her own fascination with Virginia’s grandfather, the still handsome General Waverly. This awkward précis is clunky and unnecessary, and I was baffled as to its purpose.</p>\n<p>The letter is followed by a prologue introducing readers to a young Gabriel, and explains the story that fuels this series. The Sharpe siblings’ parents died when Gabriel was seven. This is the fourth <b><i>Hellions</i></b> book, and in each novel Gabriel and his siblings have uncovered clues that will lead them &#8211; in the fifth and last book (coming out in January of next year) &#8211; to finally understand who killed their parents and why. As I wrote in my review of the last <b><i>Hellions</i></b> book, <b>How to Woo at Reluctant Lady</b>, the series is best read in order. I do not recommend <b>To Wed a Wild Lord</b> as a stand-alone read. Actually, I don’t recommend <b>To Wed a Wild Lord</b>. It’s not a very convincing book.</p>\n<p>Each Sharpe sibling has acted out in response to their parents’ untimely deaths and Gabriel is no exception. He has spent his adult life challenging mortality. He’s raced his horses dangerously so many times he’s earned the social sobriquet of “the Angel of Death.” In one such race, he and his best friend Roger Waverly raced a course where closely placed boulders allowed only one racer to pass and, as the two tried to “thread the needle,” Roger crashed and died. Roger’s remaining family — his younger sister Virginia and his bitter grandfather — blame Gabe for Roger’s death.</p>\n<p>For his part, Gabe feels responsible for Virginia. When her brother, the heir, was killed, she lost the promise of a place to live once her grandfather dies. Furthermore, Gabe, like his siblings, must marry within the year or his grandmother will disinherit them all. So Gabe decides he will offer marriage to Virginia. By doing so he will address the guilt he feels over his part in her brother’s death, ensure Virginia a home of her own, and meet his grandmother’s demands. In the first chapter of the book, Gabe goes to a ball he’s made sure Virginia will be attending, asks her to dance, and shares his plan with her. She thinks his proposal is absurd; I suspect readers will as well.</p>\n<p>Equally ridiculous is her challenge to him. She demands he race her on the dangerous course on which her brother died. She’s convinced she’ll beat him, embarrass him, and thus garner revenge for her brother’s death. This is such a stupid idea — she’ll risk death to shame someone who she believes doesn’t feel shame — I could barely take it seriously. Gabe, however, swayed no doubt by her beauty — she has, among other stellar attributes, eyes that “a man could wander for days in” — agrees to race her (on a lesser course) with the caveat that if he wins, he will court her.</p>\n<p>It’s a shame Gabriel and Virginia are given such an unpromising setup in which to fall in love, because I liked the two.

                "text": "Ms. Jeffries’ latest in her Hellions of Halstead Hall series begins inauspiciously with an odd letter to readers from a character in the novel — the grandmother of the hellacious Sharpe siblings. In it, Hetty Plumtree frets about her grandson Gabriel&#8217;s willful ways, speculates about his feelings for Virginia Waverly (the sister of Gabriel’s dead best friend), and confesses her own fascination with Virginia’s grandfather, the still handsome General Waverly. This awkward précis is clunky and unnecessary, and I was baffled as to its purpose. The letter is followed by a prologue introducing readers to a young Gabriel, and explains the story that fuels this series. The Sharpe siblings’ parents died when Gabriel was seven. This is the fourth Hellions book, and in each novel Gabriel and his siblings have uncovered clues that will lead them &#8211; in the fifth and last book (coming out in January of next year) &#8211; to finally understand who killed their parents and why. As I wrote in my review of the last Hellions book, How to Woo at Reluctant Lady, the series is best read in order. I do not recommend To Wed a Wild Lord as a stand-alone read. Actually, I don’t recommend To Wed a Wild Lord. It’s not a very convincing book. Each Sharpe sibling has acted out in response to their parents’ untimely deaths and Gabriel is no exception. He has spent his adult life challenging mortality. He’s raced his horses dangerously so many times he’s earned the social sobriquet of “the Angel of Death.” In one such race, he and his best friend Roger Waverly raced a course where closely placed boulders allowed only one racer to pass and, as the two tried to “thread the needle,” Roger crashed and died. Roger’s remaining family — his younger sister Virginia and his bitter grandfather — blame Gabe for Roger’s death. For his part, Gabe feels responsible for Virginia. When her brother, the heir, was killed, she lost the promise of a place to live once her grandfather dies. Furthermore, Gabe, like his siblings, must marry within the year or his grandmother will disinherit them all. So Gabe decides he will offer marriage to Virginia. By doing so he will address the guilt he feels over his part in her brother’s death, ensure Virginia a home of her own, and meet his grandmother’s demands. In the first chapter of the book, Gabe goes to a ball he’s made sure Virginia will be attending, asks her to dance, and shares his plan with her. She thinks his proposal is absurd; I suspect readers will as well. Equally ridiculous is her challenge to him. She demands he race her on the dangerous course on which her brother died. She’s convinced she’ll beat him, embarrass him, and thus garner revenge for her brother’s death. This is such a stupid idea — she’ll risk death to shame someone who she believes doesn’t feel shame — I could barely take it seriously. Gabe, however, swayed no doubt by her beauty — she has, among other stellar attributes, eyes that “a man could wander for days in” — agrees to race her (on a lesser course) with the caveat that if he wins, he will court her. It’s a shame Gabriel and Virginia are given such an unpromising setup in which to fall in love, because I liked the two. Gabriel is a daredevil whose insouciant arrogance covers his deep fear of losing anyone he loves. He’s a much better man than he lets anyone see and I enjoyed watching him face his demons. Virginia is a smart, capable woman who has been rather thanklessly running her grandfather’s home and horse farm. She longs to experience more of life than she’s been offered and to be seen as more than just an average miss. Both are witty, intelligent, and care deeply for their families.

                "html": "<p>As I read Ms. Brockway’s much anticipated <b>The Other Guy’s Bride</b>, I was reminded of one of my favorite featherweight films, the 1999 romantic comedy caper “The Mummy.” The novel, like that delirious movie, stars a strong willed, smart tongued English lass and a sexy, cynical swashbuckler traveling together across early 20th century Egypt, escaping bad guys, outracing sand storms and, of course, falling in love. If you like your romances over the top, filled with danger, passion, and adventure, you will adore <b>The Other Guy’s Bride</b>.</p>\n<p>Genisse Braxton hails from a world renowned archaeology-oriented family. Her father, Harry Braxton, is the most successful locator of tombs in Egypt; her mother Desdemona (Dizzy) Braxton is a famous and excessively brilliant linguist. Genisse’s six younger brothers too are making names for themselves in the antiquities world: The eldest of the six is an expert in embalming techniques and 18 year old Francis is a whiz at spotting — and making — forged artifacts. Genisse longs to join, even surpass, her family’s ranks. After studying ancient history at Cambridge (Ms. Brockway acknowledges she took several liberties with history; one is that Cambridge, in the early 20th century, admitted women and had a program in ancient history), Genisse becomes a glorified clerk to handsome Professor Lord Tynesborough, the youngest distinguished professor in the history of the college. One day she stumbles across an ancient bill of lading that convinces her the fabled lost city of Zerzura exists deep in the western Sahara. After doing months of surreptitious research under the watchful eye of Tynesborough, she decides to take hold of her fate. She boards a boat bound for Cairo — the city where her family lives and she grew up — determined to find Zerzura.</p>\n<p>Genisse has two problems. One, she hasn’t any money for such a trek. Two, she can’t travel to Zerzura on her own and no one in Egypt would dare take Harry Braxton’s daughter on such a perilous journey. She is presented with the perfect solution to her quandaries, however, in mild-mannered Mildred Whimpelhall, the wildly seasick woman traveling in the cabin next to Genisse’s. Mildred is ultimately headed to Fort Gordon, an English garrison not thirty miles from where Genisse believes Zerzura lies, to join her fiancé Colonel Lord Pomfrey. Pomfrey has arranged for Mildred, once she arrives in Cairo, to be escorted across the desert by a man he describes as a <i>“yellow-haired American cowboy… a ruffian of the highest order”</i> named James Owens. Genisse convinces Mildred to travel the rest of the way to Cairo by non-nausea inducing train, uses henna to dye her brown hair a revolting red, and assumes meek Mildred&#8217;s identity.</p>\n<p>The only thing James Owens loathes more than Colonel Lord Pomfrey is the debt he owes the man for saving James’s life seven years ago. James, known across Egypt and Northern Africa as a deadly soldier of fortune, has agreed to escort Mildred Whimpelhall across the Sahara in order to discharge his debt. As he waits at the crowded Misr train station in Cairo, ruing the fact he has to spend the next weeks with a proper English spinster, he runs into one of the few people he calls a friend, Haji Elkamal. The urbane and educated Haji, whose aunt is the wonderful Magi from <b>As You Desire</b>, has been sent to pick up Ginesse, with whom he has a long and combative history. (The two grew up together and battled constantly. Haji in a sense won when he managed to get Ginny blamed for burning a cache of ancient papyrus and subsequently sent away to British boarding school.) Ginny/Mildred alights from the train and encounters both men. Jim thinks, despite her astonishingly hideous coiffure, she’s gorgeous; Haji, thrown off by the red hair and dark glasses she’s donned, doesn’t recognize her. The encounter is perfectly done and damn funny. Ginny pretends to mistake Haji for a common servant and treats him like a dog. Haji, believing Ginny is the English born and bred Mildred, curses the rude Miss Whimpelhall to Jim in Arabic which Ginny speaks but doesn’t acknowledge knowing. Jim acts the part of the rough, uncouth buckaroo — no one will be surprised to learn that Jim Owens is more than what he seems to be — while cracking up at Ginny/Mildred’s xenophobic insults to Haji. Ms. Brockway is a <b><i>very</i></b> amusing writer; scene after scene in this book reduced me to helpless giggles.</p>\n<p>Ms. Brockway is equally excellent at portraying (Anglo) Egypt at the turn of the century. I’ve never been to Cairo, but after reading Ms. Brockway’s marvelous descriptions of that city I’m longing to go. Here’s Ginny’s view as her train slides into the city she loves:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Minarets pointed heavenward like slender fingers, while beneath them the round domes of the mosques glowed as smooth and white as a concubine’s breasts. To the south, the old city jumbled in fanciful confusion along twisting alleys and narrow, rutted lanes in direct contrast to the ponderous purposefulness of the European district with its orderly houses and wide, lebbeck-canopied avenues. The afternoon wind had begun churning dust from the streets and shaking it over Cairo’s head like a manic cleaner woman beating a rug, enveloping the city in a shimmering shroud.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Whether rendering clueless chattering British matrons taking tea at Shepheard’s Hotel or the harsh ugliness of a desert oasis, Ms. Brockway makes her fictional world vivid, real, and enticing.</p>\n<p>I didn’t find Jim and Ginny to be as authentic as the settings they inhabited. I didn’t care. The two &#8211; indeed every single man, woman, child, and donkey in this novel &#8211; are marvelously entertaining. Haji, Tynesborough, Ginny’s grandfather Sir Robert, even starchy Miss Whimpelhall and priggish Pomfrey all enliven and enrich the narrative. What they lack in verisimilitude, they make up for in allure. This book reads like a movie — think <b>Raiders of the Ark</b>, <b><i>not</i></b> <b>The English Patient.</b> The dialogue is fabulously droll and dramatic; the action scenes, death defying; the chemistry between the leads, on par with that of Bogart and Bacall.</p>\n<p>The book’s truly strong elements make its few weak ones stand out. Ginny, for a brainy broad, is for too long enamored of romance rather than love, and it’s frustrating to watch her reject the latter because she’s miffed she’s not been offered the former. The last chapters of the novel are relationally repetitive — Ginny works herself into vacuous tizzies over issues with no real emotional substance. In both <b>As You Desire</b> and <b>The Other Guy’s Bride</b>, Ms. Brockway portrays Egypt’s English plunderers as admirable but, in certain circumstances, misguided. As anyone who has ever followed the international cultural wars over the Elgin Marbles knows, the issues underlying colonial archeology are complicated. In her attempt to stay out of that battle, Ms. Brockway lessens the power of the elements of her tale built on the quest for artifacts and ancient ruins. The villain, an iniquitous thug who’s a superb camp cook, suffers from one too many motivations—greed, revenge, a taste for sadistic violence — and a bargain he makes at the novel’s end makes dubious sense. Lastly, I was bothered by Ginny’s propensity for punching Jim. At one point he asks her to stop and she retorts <i>“I wouldn’t have to if you didn’t keep saying things that provoke me.”</i> If their roles were reversed, Jim would be a base abuser. Why should such aggression be tolerated from the heroine when we would be revolted by it in the hero?</p>\n<p>All in all, though, <b>The Other Guy’s Bride</b> is great fun. It’s a worthy sequel to <b>As You Desire</b> (although I was a little appalled at Dizzy’s fecundity) and can enjoyably be read as a standalone story.

Somerton, often called the most eligible bachelor in the country, is her neighbor back at home in Gloucestershire and her family is vastly socially inferior to his. The Belmonts are a ramshackle bunch. Eugenie’s father is a trickster; her mother, a flighty emotional ditherer. Her twin brothers are always in trouble; her brother Terry has taken up gambling and speaking rudely. Only her animal whispering younger brother Jack does anything to help Eugenie keep the family on track.

As Jack and Eugenie tried to maneuver the recalcitrant goat, they were almost run over by Somerton who was going for an absurdly fast ride on his country roads. After Sinclair made it clear he was THE DUKE OF SOMERTON, he offered to take Erik into his stables. Somerton didn’t do this to be helpful. No &#8211; he saw Jack was gifted at working with animals.

The four, under the non-watchful eye of Violet’s young governess — she’s being led astray by the bricklayer’s feckless son — bond despite their social differences. Violet, an orphan being raised by an overprotective aunt and uncle, is especially drawn to Kit. He is smart, athletic, and literally desperate to escape the future the workhouse he lives in promises.

All it takes is one conversation and, boom, she’s the reason he draws breath each day. Lucky for him, Violet is equally easily won over.

Kit and Violet are a tease of a couple… so much so that I wondered if Ms. Hunter has embraced an “Abstinence Only” philosophy.

In fact, pretty much nothing about Ms. Mallery’s latest in the <b><i>Fool’s Gold</i></b> series didn&#8217;t. This was my first time reading a book by Ms. Mallery and I suspect it will be my last.</p>\n<p>The heroine of this book is Nevada Hendrix. Nevada and her big wacky family live in Fool’s Gold, a town that could only exist in fiction. Everyone in the town has either an eccentric personality and/or a troubled past. Women run the place which is crime, politics, and reality free. As the story begins, Nevada is interviewing for a job as construction manager for the new casino Janack Construction is building on nearby tribal land. She’d thought she’d be interviewed by the head of the firm, Elliot Janack, but, to her horror, finds herself facing his son Tucker, who as the first line of the book points out, has seen her naked.</p>\n<p>Ten years ago, when Nevada was in college in Los Angeles, she, on the advice of her elder brother Ethan — he and Tucker were friends for a summer in high school— looked up Tucker. The very moment she saw him, she “could only stare at the man she knew she would love for the rest of her life.” Sadly, her “love at first sight” wasn’t mutual. Tucker was already madly in love with gorgeous, famous sculptress (and utter narcissist) Caterina “Cat” Stoicasescu. One night, Cat (who is a total tool) breaks up with Tucker and tells Nevada Tucker needs her in his time of sorrow. Nevada hurries to Tucker’s sloshed side, seduces him (even though she’s a virgin), then gets her heart broken first when Tucker yowls Cat’s name as he comes and then again when, a day later, Cat takes Tucker back.</p>\n<p>After awkwardly acknowledging their past, Tucker hires Nevada and they become reacquainted. Nevada still loves Tucker but won’t admit it. Tucker, after being Cat’s bitch, has sworn off love forever. The two proceed to behave in truly perplexing ways. Tucker is bizarrely flirty with Nevada even though she’s his employee and Fool’s Gold is one of those small towns where everyone knows everything anyone does. Nevada wants to professionally impress all the men who work for her, but still begins having sex with Tucker. Neither Tucker nor Nevada made a lick of sense to me. The first time they have sex — <b><i>in the trailer on the work site</i></b> — they are desperate to find a condom. The second time — in Nevada’s bathtub — birth control isn’t mentioned. I’m not even sure why they were having sex in the first place. Ms. Mallery writes as though their lust for one another is a given. Their passion feels flat, even fake, as do their post coital chats. They are neither an interesting nor believable pair.</p>\n<p>They are in good company. Almost no one in <b>Only His</b> is interesting <b><i>or</i></b> believable. Many of them are, at times, unlikable. There’s a scene near the beginning of the book where Nevada tells her mother, in confidence, the story of her tragic collegiate tryst with Tucker. Her mother, Denise, then tells Nevada’s brother Ethan so that he will “punish” Tucker. Ethan, who never knew his old friend had done the deed with Nevada, goes to the local bar where Tucker is having lunch, punches him in the face, and then dines with him. In the alternative universe that is the town of Fool’s Gold, Denise and Ethan are acting lovingly and everybody has a good laugh. Again, I didn’t get it. I’d be mighty peeved at my mom if she treated my secrets with so little care and at my brothers were they to behave like overprotective morons.</p>\n<p>Denise acts oddly more than once in this story. <b>Only His</b> has two prominent secondary romances one of which involves Denise, who has been widowed for over a decade, and her first lover Max whose name she has tattooed on her hip. Their love story is a mix of hot sex (Nevada is sooo bummed to walk in on them doing it on the kitchen table) and cold rebuttals (Denise feels guilty for loving another man.) Just as she does with her primary lovers, Ms. Mallery gives little to bolster the asserted attraction and feelings between Max and Denise.</p>\n<p>The best couple in the book is that of Jo, the bar owner, and Will, an employee and friend of Tucker’s. While Ms. Mallery doesn’t bother to justify their attraction either, they are appealing people. That said, at one point in their trajectory, Will is such a jerk, I found it hard to continue to care about his happiness. Jo, I liked. She might be, along with Annabelle the librarian, the only person in the novel whom I can imagine existing and wanting to talk to.

It’s sweet, the heroine didn’t get enough love as a small child, she hides her true self under a faux sex-kitten persona, and her hunky best friend turns out to be — and this is just a shock to our girl — madly in love with the real her. I, however, am not such a reader. I found <b>Swept off her Stilettos</b> to be prosaic, predictable, and passionless.</p>\n<p>Coreen Fraser had a bad mom who loved poorly. Coreen is determined to never make that same mistake and thus only likes men who are mad for her and whom she can keep at an emotional and physical distance. Coreen works hard to get these guys. She’s perfected her sexy sway, and always wears red high heels, tons of make-up, and skintight sexy vintage clothes. The book is written in first person which, for me, was a problem, because I found Coreen a self-absorbed ninny. She natters on and on about how alluring she is and how important it is that she is so alluring. She’s that person who really would say to someone she’s just met and chattered to: “But enough about me. Let’s talk about you. What do you think about me?”</p>\n<p>Coreen’s best friend — and this friendship seemed as likely as Pope pushing premarital sex — is a successful, super cute straight guy named Adam Conrad. Adam has been Coreen’s bestest bud for years. The two have inside jokes, pal around, eat ethnic food, and never once does Coreen wonder if Adam might want to get into her pencil skirts.</p>\n<p>However, when Coreen decides to make a serious play for wealthy Sloan ranger Nicholas Chatterton–Jones, Adam makes his move. He kisses her while the two are away at a murder mystery weekend and tells her she must choose between losing him or loving him.</p>\n<p>There’s really nothing in the book I find worth sharing. It’s not awful; it’s just banal. Ms. Harper has an excellent grasp of the English language but not of the mysteries of the human heart. No one in this book is real or engaging and what little plot there is is pedestrian. It’s lighter than air, completely inoffensive, and imminently forgettable.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure there are those who like their romances completely sweet and substance free. Not me. I need heart and a bit of heft in my novels and there&#8217;s none to be found in <b>Swept off her Stilettos</b>.</p>\n",

I, however, am not such a reader. I found Swept off her Stilettos to be prosaic, predictable, and passionless. Coreen Fraser had a bad mom who loved poorly. Coreen is determined to never make that same mistake and thus only likes men who are mad for her and whom she can keep at an emotional and physical distance. Coreen works hard to get these guys. She’s perfected her sexy sway, and always wears red high heels, tons of make-up, and skintight sexy vintage clothes. The book is written in first person which, for me, was a problem, because I found Coreen a self-absorbed ninny. She natters on and on about how alluring she is and how important it is that she is so alluring. She’s that person who really would say to someone she’s just met and chattered to: “But enough about me. Let’s talk about you. What do you think about me?” Coreen’s best friend — and this friendship seemed as likely as Pope pushing premarital sex — is a successful, super cute straight guy named Adam Conrad. Adam has been Coreen’s bestest bud for years. The two have inside jokes, pal around, eat ethnic food, and never once does Coreen wonder if Adam might want to get into her pencil skirts. However, when Coreen decides to make a serious play for wealthy Sloan ranger Nicholas Chatterton–Jones, Adam makes his move. He kisses her while the two are away at a murder mystery weekend and tells her she must choose between losing him or loving him. There’s really nothing in the book I find worth sharing. It’s not awful; it’s just banal. Ms. Harper has an excellent grasp of the English language but not of the mysteries of the human heart. No one in this book is real or engaging and what little plot there is is pedestrian. It’s lighter than air, completely inoffensive, and imminently forgettable. I&#8217;m sure there are those who like their romances completely sweet and substance free. Not me. I need heart and a bit of heft in my novels and there&#8217;s none to be found in Swept off her Stilettos."

If you yearn for a contemporary romance with lovers who have heat and heart, secondary characters with verve and humor, a locale you’d love to visit, and sentences that make you laugh and cry, please pick up Animal Attraction. Then plan to stay up reading late into the night. In the meantime, I think I’ll pick it up for the third time. There’s a scene on page 179 I want to read again. And one on page 194… and on page 262&#8230; Like I said, it’s a great book. Buy it at Amazon/iBooks/Barnes and Noble/Kobo"

She’s convinced her young orphaned niece, Georgina, is being held against the child’s will by her stepmother for financial gain. Francesca has been turned down by solicitor after solicitor — her case is iffy <b><i>and</i></b> she’s a woman — but she finally convinces the best lawyer in London, a Mr. Wittiers, to take her case.

Wittiers has been called to work on what might be “the case of the decade” for a titled client and her case no longer interests him.</p>\n<p>The titled client is Edward de Lacey, the second son of the recently dead Duke of Durham. Edward has a big problem. Moments after his father passed away, the family solicitor informed Edward and his younger brother Gerard that they, and their dissolute elder brother Charlie, may all be illegitimate with no claim to their family’s wealth and property. The departed Duke married someone other than their mother in his youth, neglected to get divorced, and the fate of the first wife is unknown. If she was living when the Duke married their mother, the second marriage would be invalid and his three sons would be, legally, bastards.</p>\n<p>Edward is his family’s rock, the son who manages both the Durham money and the Durham name. He’s a calm, smart, proper man who cherishes order. When he discovers his possible paucity of proper parentage, he’s flummoxed and fearful. After his family’s secret hits the nastiest of London’s tabloids, his fears are realized in the worst way: The woman he loves breaks off their engagement, his older brother sinks further into debauchery, and his younger brother, a military hero, begins muttering about murder. So when the tempestuous, flame-haired Francesca arrives at his house and upbraids him for stealing her counsel, he makes a pact with her. She’ll use her influence with the publisher of the news rag to have the story pulled and Edward will help her find a decent lawyer.</p>\n<p>I’m not sure why this book left me so unmoved. Francesca is a flawed heroine, but in a good way. She has a wayward temper, iffy judgment, and uses her beauty to manipulate those around her. She’s a good foil for Edward who, out of the boudoir, is an uptight guy. The two have good chemistry together and, with the exception of a brief plot faux pas at the end of the novel, make a reasonable pair.

I detest feeling manipulated; in this book, the ending screams “BUY THE NEXT BOOK AND FIND OUT WHAT THAT MYSTERIOUS LETTER SAID.” Lastly, I found the mystery undergirding the tale — what happened to the Duke’s first wife — to be uninteresting.

At one such ball, Grier is hiding behind a fern and shoving frosted biscuits in her mouth when she hears two men talking. The taller and broader of the two is clearly looking for a bride but when his companion suggests Grier or Cleo, the man dismisses the sisters as completely unsuitable. He and his friend quip that Grier and Cleo are women a man beds rather than weds.

Poor Sevastian has a heavy crown to bear. His country has recently been through a terrible war in which he fought and helped win. Many Maldanians died including his older brother — the man who should have been the next king. Sevastian is in London to find a bride: A wealthy, blue-blooded beauty worthy of the title of Queen. For him, marriage is about duty to his country not about the passions of his heart.</p>\n<p>I am sure you can guess where this story is going. Grier finds the Prince gorgeous, arrogant, and incredibly hot. He finds Grier feisty, alluring, and wants to bed her but not wed her. The two bicker, flirt, ride horses too fast, explosively kiss, and ultimately… Well, I don’t want to spoil the dénouement for you, but if you can’t see the ending from the moment Grier douses the Prince you’ve never read a by-the-numbers historical romance.</p>\n<p>The writing in this book is a notch below mediocre.

Sevastian presses Grier to be his mistress almost immediately, a few pages later he tells her to stay away.

Three years ago, Walfort and his cousin the Duke of Ainsley were out carousing in celebration of the news of Jayne’s pregnancy. Their carriage crashed; Walfort was terribly injured and left paralyzed from the waist down. In her grief, Jayne lost their baby — her first and, due to Walfort’s impotency, what would seem to be her last.

She’s lonely and mourns the life of wife and mother she always thought she’d have.</p>\n<p>Ainsley is grief stricken as well. He was driving the carriage the night of the accident and blames himself for all Walfort — and Jayne &#8211; lost with the crash. He knows Jayne loathes him for his carelessness that night and makes every effort to stay out of her sight. So, when Walfort asks him to come early to the first hunt he has hosted since his accident, Ainsley wishes he could say no. He can’t, of course; Ainsley would do almost anything to pay the debt he feels he owes Walfort. When he arrives, however, Ainsley is unprepared for what Walfort asks of him. Walfort tells Ainsley his debt will be settled if he will get Jayne pregnant and allow Walfort to pass the babe off as Walfort’s own.</p>\n<p>Neither Ainsley nor Jayne initially says yes to Walfort’s proposal. Ainsley believes that it would devastate Jayne to betray her sacred marriage vows. Both Jayne and Ainsley believe that it’s wrong for Ainsley to be the father of Walfort’s legal heir. Jayne dislikes Ainsley and can’t imagine having him touch her. Ainsley has always been profoundly drawn to Jayne and doesn’t know if, once he has had her and she is pregnant with his child, he could live without her. Walfort, though, is determined. He tells Ainsley that if Ainsley — a man who is famous for his skills as a lover — won’t impregnate Jayne, Walfort will find some far more loutish lord who will. Walfort too wears down Jayne’s objections. He tells her he loves her and he can’t be happy until she has the child she has always wanted.

She has asked their lovemaking be brief, they never kiss, and she take no pleasure from his touch. She is there for Walfort and makes it clear she disdains Ainsley. But as the two begin to spend all their time together, Jayne realizes her perception of Ainsley as a cad is false. He, in the way he treats her and those around him, is a good and honorable man. Ainsley “wakes” Jayne up to all that she is missing, both in the bedroom and in her heart. He never kisses her, but he pleasures her beyond anything she could have ever imagined.

Vivi, a skateboarder who never wears a dress, has avoided any real intimacy with men all her adult life.

I enjoyed that book, <b>One Touch of Scandal</b>, but had forgotten its premise. I was glad I did — <b>One Touch of Scandal</b> is a fun tale and rereading it placed the plot and the characters in <b>The Bride Wore Scarlet</b> in context. One could read <b>The Bride Wore Scarlet</b> without having read <b>One Touch of Scandal</b>, but it wouldn’t be as <b><i>meaningful</i></b>.</p>\n<p>I use that word deliberately. In this series Ms. Carlyle poses significant questions about destiny, fate, and responsibility. Her heroes and heroines struggle, at times painfully, to carve out lives — and loves — true to the tasks and talents life has bestowed upon them.</p>\n<p>The hero in <b>The Bride Wore Scarlet</b> is Geoff, Lord Bessett — the son of the couple from an earlier Ms. Carlyle novel <b>Three Little Secrets</b>. Geoff, like the hero in <b>One Touch of Scandal</b>, has the gift of the Sight. The word gift, though, is a misnomer. It’s no gift to see the dangers about and the deaths to come of those around you. It’s a huge responsibility and requires enormous mental discipline. Geoff has that discipline, but it’s made him a chilly, almost remote man. The one thing he gives himself to is the work of the St. James Society (the fraternity of the series), an ancient group of Guardians whose mission is to protect those with the gift of the Sight, called the Vateis, typically women and children, from those who would exploit the Vateis’ abilities for evil ends. Additionally, Geoff, who has struggled with the burden of the Sight all his life, knows a child with the Sight must be trained to understand and successfully manage the gift. So, when the Society learns there is a young Vateis in Brussels whose Guardian has been murdered and who, with her mother, is virtually imprisoned by an iniquitous man (the rogue plans to use the girl’s gift to restore the French monarchy) Geoff volunteers to go to Brussels and convey the mother and daughter back to England.</p>\n<p>Geoff needs a pretext to approach the faux family in Brussels — the villain, Lezennes, is a smart and wily man who has made it very difficult for anyone to speak to the girl (Giselle) or her mother (Charlotte Moreau). The perfect cover would be a wife, which Geoff most certainly does not have. However, before Geoff can begin the search for a suitable woman to pretend to be his bride, he and the rest of the Society are called to a sacred Fraternitas ritual: The initiation of a new Guardian.</p>\n<p>The new Guardian — sponsored by Lord Lazenby, a secondary character who is quite intriguing &#8211; is not what Geoff or anyone other than Lord Lazenby expected. All the Guardians are male and the new acolyte is a young woman. This woman, Anais de Rohan — the daughter of the lovers from Ms. Carlyle’s <b>No True Gentleman</b> &#8211; has trained all her life to be a Guardian. She too has the Sight, although it comes to her through the Tarot and she denies its power. Since Anais was a child, her beloved grandmother, herself an exceptional Tarot reader, told Anais it is her destiny to become part of the Fraternitas and to fight against a great evil. (Her nonna also told her Anais would marry a man from Tuscany.) The St. James Society, however, is adamant that no woman may be inducted into the Fraternitas. A compromise is hammered out.

                "html": "<p>As a reviewer, I aim to be fair. But true fairness implies a lack of context for each book and I doubt I am quite that impartial. I tend to read debuts with greater charity; I suspect I am harder on authors I’ve read and loved. Melody Thomas falls into the latter category. Her Donally family series is a favorite; its <b>Match Made in Scandal</b>, a DIK for me. When I read Ms. Thomas, I expect a neat plot, clever dialogue, and persuasive lovers. <b>This Perfect Kiss</b> was unsatisfactory on all three fronts.</p>\n<p>The novel, a Scottish tale based loosely on the Cinderella motif, begins with a kiss between the illegitimate, half-American Christel Douglas and Camden, the earl of Carrick. He is a decorated British hero and she has crashed a ball held in his honor. Christel has loved Camden for years. She’s come to this ball to ask him to seduce her — in a few weeks time he’s to choose a bride from his class and she sees this night as her last chance to have, even if it’s just once, the man she loves. Christel, dressed in a golden mask, a golden dress she’s made, and golden slippers she’s sold her hair to buy, follows Camden out into the garden and the two kiss. As they embrace, servants call for Camden to rejoin the ball and the two then part without Camden knowing who she is.</p>\n<p>Nine years later, as the now widowed Camden — he married Christel’s aristocratic cousin Saundra — boards his ship in London, planning to travel home to Scotland with his young daughter, his first mate tells him that a woman is on board and she claims to be Camden’s late wife’s cousin. The woman is, of course, Christel, whom Camden now knows is the girl he kissed all those years ago. Christel has spent the last nine years in America helping the Colonial cause. Christel tells Camden she returned because Saundra, who has been dead for almost two years, sent her a letter asking Christel to come and be the governess for Saundra’s and Camden’s daughter, Anna. (It’s a mystery who sent the letter.) Camden says he’d never hire a “colonial urchin” to care for his child. Christel says she appreciates his perspective and then asks him to take her with him back to Scotland. She longs to settle in the cottage her parents (her father, a lord, lived there in sin with her mother) left her and live a peaceful post-Revolutionary war life.</p>\n<p>As I read <b>This Perfect Kiss</b>, I kept waiting to get pulled into the story. There are mysteries aplenty facing Camden and Christel when they return to Scotland. Why did Saundra throw herself to her death… or was she pushed? Who is trying to frame Camden as a traitor to the ruling British? Who is smuggling French goods and why? What roles did Camden, Christel, and those around them really play in the Revolutionary War? But none of these conundrums is especially intriguing and having so many of them is often confusing. It’s not overly hard to figure out who is behind much of the villainy and, when Ms. Thomas finally answers all the riddles she’s posed, it’s a hurried letdown.</p>\n<p>Camden and Christel desire each other but don’t, for most of the novel, trust or treasure each other. They, like too many couples in historical romance, believe the disparity in their social stations poses too great a barrier to their relationship. This class-based trope so defines their pairing it weakens the believability of their love. When they make love for the first time, Christel literally leaves Camden asleep in her bed and goes to stare at her mother’s grave. When Camden comes to find her, she tells him their night together was a singular event — she is sure she and Camden can never live the ostracized life her parents did. I never felt their connection, nor did I trust their ability to transcend the differences between them.</p>\n<p>The finest thing in <b>This Perfect Kiss</b> is its context. Ms. Thomas fills her book with fascinating facts about Scotland’s role in the Revolutionary War. Many Scots were on the side of the Americans and actively fought and/or spied against the British. She does a great job of showing the connections between smuggling and the Revolutionary War. Ms. Thomas makes her characters’ actions fit the time in which they lived in ways that are interesting and further her plot. The history part of this historical romance is excellent.</p>\n<p>When I finished <b>This Perfect Kiss</b>, I pondered why I found the tale lacking. The writing is excellent; the context, strong; and the characters, faceted. I decided the problem lies in the lovers themselves. I never felt Christel and Camden belonged together. When they interacted, both physically and verbally, it seemed muted. At the beginning of the book, as they stand in the garden, Camden tells Christel he knows nothing about her &#8211; she’s masked and completely out of context for him. She recites a list of poetically haphazard things: she loves “the way the air smells in spring …cold milk with warm bread… roses and summertime.” Her words reveal nothing about who she specifically is and yet Camden always remembers them, even quoting them back to her almost a decade later. This shallow awareness of each other permeates the book. Even as they found their HEA, I wasn’t sure either really knew the other.</p>\n<p>Have I been too hard on Ms. Thomas? Maybe. But I know she can write a better book than <b>The Perfect Kiss</b>.</p>\n",

The novel, a Scottish tale based loosely on the Cinderella motif, begins with a kiss between the illegitimate, half-American Christel Douglas and Camden, the earl of Carrick. He is a decorated British hero and she has crashed a ball held in his honor. Christel has loved Camden for years. She’s come to this ball to ask him to seduce her — in a few weeks time he’s to choose a bride from his class and she sees this night as her last chance to have, even if it’s just once, the man she loves. Christel, dressed in a golden mask, a golden dress she’s made, and golden slippers she’s sold her hair to buy, follows Camden out into the garden and the two kiss. As they embrace, servants call for Camden to rejoin the ball and the two then part without Camden knowing who she is. Nine years later, as the now widowed Camden — he married Christel’s aristocratic cousin Saundra — boards his ship in London, planning to travel home to Scotland with his young daughter, his first mate tells him that a woman is on board and she claims to be Camden’s late wife’s cousin. The woman is, of course, Christel, whom Camden now knows is the girl he kissed all those years ago. Christel has spent the last nine years in America helping the Colonial cause. Christel tells Camden she returned because Saundra, who has been dead for almost two years, sent her a letter asking Christel to come and be the governess for Saundra’s and Camden’s daughter, Anna. (It’s a mystery who sent the letter.) Camden says he’d never hire a “colonial urchin” to care for his child. Christel says she appreciates his perspective and then asks him to take her with him back to Scotland. She longs to settle in the cottage her parents (her father, a lord, lived there in sin with her mother) left her and live a peaceful post-Revolutionary war life. As I read This Perfect Kiss, I kept waiting to get pulled into the story. There are mysteries aplenty facing Camden and Christel when they return to Scotland. Why did Saundra throw herself to her death… or was she pushed? Who is trying to frame Camden as a traitor to the ruling British? Who is smuggling French goods and why? What roles did Camden, Christel, and those around them really play in the Revolutionary War? But none of these conundrums is especially intriguing and having so many of them is often confusing. It’s not overly hard to figure out who is behind much of the villainy and, when Ms. Thomas finally answers all the riddles she’s posed, it’s a hurried letdown. Camden and Christel desire each other but don’t, for most of the novel, trust or treasure each other. They, like too many couples in historical romance, believe the disparity in their social stations poses too great a barrier to their relationship. This class-based trope so defines their pairing it weakens the believability of their love. When they make love for the first time, Christel literally leaves Camden asleep in her bed and goes to stare at her mother’s grave. When Camden comes to find her, she tells him their night together was a singular event — she is sure she and Camden can never live the ostracized life her parents did. I never felt their connection, nor did I trust their ability to transcend the differences between them. The finest thing in This Perfect Kiss is its context. Ms. Thomas fills her book with fascinating facts about Scotland’s role in the Revolutionary War. Many Scots were on the side of the Americans and actively fought and/or spied against the British. She does a great job of showing the connections between smuggling and the Revolutionary War. Ms. Thomas makes her characters’ actions fit the time in which they lived in ways that are interesting and further her plot. The history part of this historical romance is excellent. When I finished This Perfect Kiss, I pondered why I found the tale lacking. The writing is excellent; the context, strong; and the characters, faceted. I decided the problem lies in the lovers themselves. I never felt Christel and Camden belonged together. When they interacted, both physically and verbally, it seemed muted. At the beginning of the book, as they stand in the garden, Camden tells Christel he knows nothing about her &#8211; she’s masked and completely out of context for him. She recites a list of poetically haphazard things: she loves “the way the air smells in spring …cold milk with warm bread… roses and summertime.” Her words reveal nothing about who she specifically is and yet Camden always remembers them, even quoting them back to her almost a decade later. This shallow awareness of each other permeates the book. Even as they found their HEA, I wasn’t sure either really knew the other. Have I been too hard on Ms. Thomas? Maybe. But I know she can write a better book than The Perfect Kiss."

                "html": "<p>Isobel Carr’s debut romance has an unusual heroine in Viola Whedon. Viola, an extravagantly beautiful woman with tumbling red-gold curls, has been one of London’s most sought after courtesans for the past decade. She is currently on the outs with her protector &#8211; he was incensed when he discovered she planned to include him in the second volume of her memoir. The first one, already published, is a favored read of the scandal hungry ton. Viola hopes the money from the second will keep her “in coal and lobster patties for years to come” as she is ready to leave the mistress business behind.</p>\n<p>Viola, at age 27, senses her days as a top “fashionable impure” are behind her, and that without a career change she’ll slip into common whoredom. She, despite having spread her legs for money for ten years, never wanted to be even an uncommon whore. (When she was just 15, she eloped. He died, both families shunned her, and as is so often the case in historical romance, young widowed Viola was too lovely to be hired for anything else.) Even worse, she doesn’t usually enjoy the sex inherent to her profession, because “the ones worth bedding were never the ones who could afford to keep her.”</p>\n<p>The hero, Lord Leonidas Vaughn, gorgeous and famed to be fabulous in bed, is definitely worth bedding.

                "text": "Isobel Carr’s debut romance has an unusual heroine in Viola Whedon. Viola, an extravagantly beautiful woman with tumbling red-gold curls, has been one of London’s most sought after courtesans for the past decade. She is currently on the outs with her protector &#8211; he was incensed when he discovered she planned to include him in the second volume of her memoir. The first one, already published, is a favored read of the scandal hungry ton. Viola hopes the money from the second will keep her “in coal and lobster patties for years to come” as she is ready to leave the mistress business behind. Viola, at age 27, senses her days as a top “fashionable impure” are behind her, and that without a career change she’ll slip into common whoredom. She, despite having spread her legs for money for ten years, never wanted to be even an uncommon whore. (When she was just 15, she eloped. He died, both families shunned her, and as is so often the case in historical romance, young widowed Viola was too lovely to be hired for anything else.) Even worse, she doesn’t usually enjoy the sex inherent to her profession, because “the ones worth bedding were never the ones who could afford to keep her.” The hero, Lord Leonidas Vaughn, gorgeous and famed to be fabulous in bed, is definitely worth bedding. Sadly he is a second son — the title of this series is The League of Second Sons &#8211; and he needs to marry money. Leo meets Viola when violent thugs break into her house in the middle of the night. She runs out into the street, terrified, begging for help, and Leo just happens to be there.

                "html": "<p><b>Trace of Fever</b> is the second in the <i><b>Men Who Walk the Edge of Honor</b></i> series by prolific author Lori Foster. In the preface, Ms. Foster writes the series is of “uber-alpha hunks featuring private mercenaries who are big, capable, a little dangerous and [she hopes] oh-so-sexy.” I didn’t read the first book, <b>When You Dare</b> and, after cringing my way through <b>Trace of Fever</b>, I doubt I ever will.</p>\n<p>The hunky mercenary hero of this book is Trace Rivers, and while he certainly is big, capable, and dangerous, I didn’t find him a whit sexy. That said, he’s vastly more alluring than this tale’s heroine Priscilla Patterson. I can’t remember the last time I disliked a heroine as much as I disliked Priss. To be fair, she’s such a poorly written character — she has about four different personalities in this one book — perhaps it’s not her fault I found her whiny, stupid, self-absorbed, and often ridiculous.

                "text": "Trace of Fever is the second in the Men Who Walk the Edge of Honor series by prolific author Lori Foster. In the preface, Ms. Foster writes the series is of “uber-alpha hunks featuring private mercenaries who are big, capable, a little dangerous and [she hopes] oh-so-sexy.” I didn’t read the first book, When You Dare and, after cringing my way through Trace of Fever, I doubt I ever will. The hunky mercenary hero of this book is Trace Rivers, and while he certainly is big, capable, and dangerous, I didn’t find him a whit sexy. That said, he’s vastly more alluring than this tale’s heroine Priscilla Patterson. I can’t remember the last time I disliked a heroine as much as I disliked Priss. To be fair, she’s such a poorly written character — she has about four different personalities in this one book — perhaps it’s not her fault I found her whiny, stupid, self-absorbed, and often ridiculous. Halfway through the book, I found myself hoping she’d have an UEA (Unhappily Ever After) ending! Trace and Priss meet because they both want to kill — literally — a total scum bucket named Murray Colburn. Murray, who is one of the more repulsive men I’ve met in fiction lately, has his stubby fingers in lots of nasty pies, but the worst one involves buying and selling women and girls for the human trafficking trade.

He muses, <i>“Passion, it lies in all of us, sleeping&#8230;waiting&#8230;and though unwanted&#8230;unbidden&#8230;it will stir&#8230;open its jaws and howl. It speaks to us&#8230;guides us&#8230;passion rules us all, and we obey. What other choice do we have? Passion is the source of our finest moments. The joy of love&#8230;the clarity of hatred&#8230;and the ecstasy of grief. It hurts sometimes more than we can bear.”</i> Rupert Delacorte, the Vincent Darling, hero of Ms. Essex&#8217;s lovely new novel, could have easily uttered those lines.</p>\n<p>The story begins at a ball in Dartmouth where Del has come hunting Celia Burke, a girl whom the ton adoringly calls &#8220;the Ravishing Miss Burke.&#8221; Del plans to seduce, without a touch, then devastate this young woman he’s never met. He blames Celia for the suicide of his younger sister Emily who had been Celia’s closest friend. His passionate hatred for Celia wars with the instant pull he feels toward her and the deep affection he had for her — via anecdotes told in his sister’s letters — before Emily’s death. Del is a seething, simmering sensualist who, from the moment he sees Celia descending the ballroom stairs, is overwhelmed by the way Celia makes him feel.</p>\n<p>Celia is equally drawn to Del. She too had fallen more than a little in love with him via the letters he wrote to Emily. When she finally meets him in all his tall, golden gorgeousness, she feels, for the first time in her life, profound physical desire. For all her external beauty, Celia is essentially a scholar. Her great passion in life, prior to listening to Del tell her all the ways he’d like to strip her naked and pleasure her, has been botany and scientifically cataloging the freshwater plants of Devon. She’s not just inexperienced; she’s unaware of the lure of the sexual world. Men, the boring aristocrats who court her for her face and family name, barely register with her… until she encounters Del. As he, using just his shockingly erotic words, whispers to Celia about desire, Celia discovers the power of passion.</p>\n<p>I enjoyed Ms. Essex’s first novel, <b>The Pursuit of Pleasure</b>, but had a hard time visualizing her two lovers. I had no such trouble in <b>A Sense of Sin</b>. Ms. Essex is an accomplished writer and she deftly depicts not only Celia and Del, but a host of interesting secondary characters. Her Georgian households and their denizens have a palpable feel. Ms. Essex doesn’t shy away from the barriers class and power place between upper crust families and their servants; nor does she deny the compassion and care that often undergird those relationships. Celia’s maid, Bains; Del’s cook, Mrs. Bobbins; Lady Burke’s coachman, Mr. Filbert; and others, all bring verve and humor into the homes they serve and the story Ms. Essex tells. Del and Celia, apart and together, are two of the more vibrant lovers I’ve encountered in historical romance. Del, furious about his sister’s death, angry at his father for existing, and contemptuous of the legion of widows, harlots, and adulterous wives he’s bedded, is undone by Celia. Ms. Essex makes the way Del falls first in exhilarating lust and then in bewildering love with Celia a moving and tempestuous thing. Celia, a generous young woman without a whiff of saccharine sweetness to her, changes the way Del sees her and then, powerfully, the way he sees himself. And she, at heart a thinker, lets Del guide her to trust her heart, her body, and her passion for him as much as she trusts her brain. I loved their story.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a compelling third character as well: The dead Emily Delacorte. As the book begins, Celia is being blackmailed by someone — initially she thinks it must be Del — who threatens to tell the world the real, damning reason Emily killed herself. Del thinks often about his sister and it is through his and Celia’s thoughts and conversations about Emily that her character is revealed. Del and Celia each loved Emily passionately, and the two grieve her death almost more than they can bear. The intrigues behind Emily’s demise — who really is blackmailing Celia and why — are gripping and affecting. The plot in <b>A Sense of Sin</b> dovetails beautifully with the developing relationship between Celia and Del.</p>\n<p>I began this review writing about passion. The sexual tension as well as the eventual sex in this book is phenomenal. For much of the book, there is no physical relationship between Celia and Del — he has sworn not to lay a hand on her and she, of course, is bound by Georgian society’s rules for virginal girls. However, without a kiss or caress, Del seduces Celia as powerfully as any lover in literature. Cyrano has nothing on Viscount Darling. Del’s language of love &#8211; Ms. Essex’s language of love &#8211; is beautiful, carnal, and utterly seductive. And when he and Celia finally do touch, their passion is incendiary.</p>\n<p>I loved the first 319 pages of this book. I didn’t want it to end and was discontented the novel stopped so abruptly. One moment, Celia and Del are facing down the true cause of Emily’s death; less than a quarter page later, evil has been dispatched and the lovers are in each other’s arms. Satisfying endings are often the most difficult task a novelist faces and, in this book, Ms. Essex has not mastered that particular challenge. <b>A Sense of Sin</b>, a story with so much passion — “the joy of love… the clarity of hatred&#8230; and the ecstasy of grief” — needs a potent finale.

Here are eleven reasons for my disinterest in <b> Eleven Scandals to Start to Win a Duke&#8217;s Heart </b>.</p>\n<p>1)The title is overwrought. Ms. Maclean’s trio of linked books is the <b><i>Love by Numbers</i></b> trilogy, and the titles all contain a little rhyme. I found this one to be particularly odd. I rarely think of scandals as something one starts. Every time, I picked up the book, I lapsed into thoughts of other titular options. <b>Eleven Secrets to Tell to Marry Very Well.</b> <b>Eleven Scenes to Throw to Catch a Duke as a Beau.</b> <b>Eleven Kisses to Bestow to Become a Noble’s Ho.</b> I suspect had the book been more engaging, I wouldn’t have been so distracted by its silly name.</p>\n<p>2)The writing is breathless to the point of annoyance. Ms. MacLean relies on italics and/or sentence fragments to show her characters’ drama-laden inner thoughts. Paragraphs like this one made me wince.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“No. <i>They were in a public place.</i> He had to stop. <i>She deserved better.</i> They had to stop. <i>Before he ruined her.</i>”</p></blockquote>\n<p>3)The book is written with the assumption the reader has read the two novels that proceed it. I hadn’t and thus had a hard time following the plot and the lives of many of the characters.</p>\n<p>4)The heroine, Juliana Fiori, the daughter of a dead Italian merchant and a disgraced bitchy English aristocrat, is so stereotypically Italian she’s almost a caricature. She’s tempestuous, wild, impulsive, and voluble. She, twice, knees a man in his <i>inguine.</i> She is, just by being, a scandal. Juliana didn’t seem real to me — I felt as though she were symbolic, a representation of passion, rather than a genuine woman.</p>\n<p>5)The hero, Simon Pearson, the Duke of Leighton, is remarkably unlikeable. He’s called “the Duke of Disdain” because he arrogantly views everyone as below him. He is “cold and impassive,” “stiff and proper and all about the title,” and “sneering.” He cares more for his family’s reputation than his family. He’s manipulative, selfish, and haughty…and not in an appealing way.</p>\n<p>6)Simon is at least fifteen years older than Juliana and yet behaves as immaturely as she does. His actions are inconsistent, self-indulgent, and even petty. He represents the ton at its most conservative, but, really, he behaves as though he’s an undisciplined, randy youth.</p>\n<p>7)For much of the book Simon publically treats Juliana as beneath him in society while privately longing for her to be beneath him in bed. He seduces her, and allows her to seduce him, despite his being engaged to another nice young woman. He, who cherishes reputation above all, is overly willing to ruin Juliana’s for the sake of his desire. He isn’t sexy, he’s demeaning.</p>\n<p>8)Early in the book, Juliana challenges Simon to a confusing wager. She tells him that she can prove that “not even a frigid duke can live without heat.” She asks for two weeks to — and this is where I became confused. Two weeks to make Simon passionate? Two weeks to make him tell her she’s right? Two weeks to ruin his reputation? By the end of the novel, it still wasn’t clear to me what the wager was to have accomplished. Given that it’s a major plot point in the book, it was irksome it wasn’t clearer.</p>\n<p>9)The two older mothers in the book, Simon’s and Juliana’s, are awful women. Both Simon and Juliana have serious emotional limitations caused by maternal neglect and dislike. For most of the book, the damage done by these maternal Cruellas influences the choices Simon and Juliana make. Then, suddenly, the two are unfettered by these mean motherly limits. The change in both characters was sudden and profound and, to me, unbelievable.</p>\n<p>10)The end of the book has a number of implausible scenes. Simon and Juliana behave in uncharacteristic ways. I understand the reader is to believe the two have been remade by love, but, here again, I didn’t buy it. To me, the transformative power of love, to be viable, needs to alter the heroine and hero in ways that are in keeping with the characters they are. I don’t trust happy endings where the lovers become completely new people with sparkly new values. In this book, both Simon and Juliana change dramatically and Simon, in particular, is unrecognizable as the man he was prior to meeting Juliana.</p>\n<p>11)Simon is the main male in this book, but, not, in behavior, the hero. Even at the end of the book, he makes choices that are hurtful and self-serving. His actions seem even less heroic compared to the story’s true male hero &#8211; if one defines a hero as he who acts bravely, ethically, and nobly &#8211; Juliana’s half brother Nick St. John. Nick is a wonderful man. In contrast to him, Simon seems an even bigger ass. I haven’t read Nick’s love story, told in the middle book of the trilogy, <b>Ten Ways to be Adored when Landing a Lord</b>, but I feel sure I’d like that book better than this one.</p>\n<p>So, there’s my list.

                "html": "<p>As I read this book, I wondered two things. First, what was the average age of marriage for Scots women in the early 16th century? Second, why do all the names of the Scottish Highland clans begin with Mac?</p>\n<p>The answer to the first was hard to find. Women did marry at a much earlier age than men &#8211; males needed to establish themselves economically before they could wed. Girls could marry as young as 12, but rarely did so. Several studies indicate that the average age for a first marriage for early Renaissance women was close to 18. The answer to the second question took just a moment to find. The prefix &#8220;Mac&#8221; means &#8220;son of&#8221; in Gaelic. Until the 1500’s, Gaelic-speaking Scots had just one name and were identified by their father. So, in Margaret Mallory’s satisfying Highlander romance <b>The Guardian</b>, the hero is called Ian, son of Payton, and he is a member of the clan MacDonald who live on the Isle of Skye.</p>\n<p>In 1508, Ian is forced to marry his thirteen year old friend Sileas MacKinnon. This unwanted union occurs because, as Ian rescues Sileas from her malevolent stepfather (the toad is about to proffer Sileas to a child rapist), he has no choice but to spend the night with her and thus compromises her. (I had a hard time with the idea of Sileas, a skinny child with too big teeth, being old enough to be compromised. Hence my wonderings about the age of marriage.) Ian is 18 and in love with a beauty he’s met at court in Stirling &#8211; the home of the then Queen: The French Mary de Guise, bride of King James V, and an important part of the Auld Alliance of Scotland and France. Ian is unequivocally unhappy with his forced matrimony and, as soon as the ceremony is done, he leaves the Isle of Skye, accompanied by his three boon companions (Connor, Alex, and Duncan, each of whom will have a book in this series) and heads to France to battle the English. Five years later, Ian and his three comrades return — they come home when they hear of the Scottish defeat at Flodden (one of the worst in Scottish history) where their chieftain and his brother were killed. Connor is now the true head of the MacDonald clan, but his iniquitous uncle Hugh Dubh, “Black Hugh,” has seized control of the clan. The four returned Highlanders endeavor to ensure that Connor becomes chieftain, something Hugh fiercely fights.</p>\n<p>Now that Ian has returned home, he plans to have his marriage to Sileas annulled. (He gets irate whenever he considers his forced marriage and does not consider himself <b><i>really</i></b> married.) However, his plans go awry when he discovers that, in his absence, Sileas has become a gorgeous, shapely beauty. (This exasperated me. Couldn’t she have just turned into an <b><i>attractive</i></b> woman? Why does she have to be the most stunning woman he’s ever seen?) Sileas has been living with his family since he left, waiting for him to return. (She, of course, has always loved him.) Suddenly, Ian is unsure whether he wants her as his wife or not. He knows he wants her in his bed, but he needs time to decide whether he wants her to be “the last woman he ever took to his bed.”</p>\n<p>I enjoyed this book. Ms. Mallory did her research and her book is full of fascinating and often real Scottish history and characters. The love story between Ian and Sileas, despite a few too many “Oh, why doesn’t he love me” moments on her part, is charming. Ian’s acute lust &#8211; compromised by his old anger &#8211; is balanced by Sileas’s struggles to fend him off until he truly wants her as his wife. Their sexual connection is strong and sweet and, when they do finally bed, it’s because they are ready to be truly wed, and are unmoored from their unhappy past.</p>\n<p>Ian’s and Sileas’s love story is set firmly into the larger story of the MacDonald clan and its political machinations. Alex, Connor, and Duncan, as well as many others in the clan, are substantial, fascinating characters. Ms. Mallory does a nice job of placing the clan’s story — which will continue in the other <b><i>Return of the Highlanders</i></b> books &#8211; in its context of early 16th century Scotland. As I read, I learned about a variety of weapons, a range of kinds of ale, the relationship between Scotland and France, unusual courtship rituals, Gaelic cultural customs, and more. I am always pleased when, in historical romance, the history is as rewarding as the romance. Such is the case in <b>The Guardian</b>.</p>\n<p>There were two things I didn’t like about this book. The first was the frequent appearance of the famed Scottish ghost, the Green Lady. She materializes at excessively useful times, at one point even stopping a rape. I don’t mind a little magic in my romance — in fact this story begins wonderfully with the four Highlander lads having their futures foretold by the local seer. In <b>The Guardian</b>, however, the Green Lady is used in ham-fisted ways and weakens the narrative. The second is an annoying occasion where Sileas, convinced that Ian doesn’t care for her, endangers the entire clan. It doesn’t make sense that Sileas, who cared faithfully for Ian’s family for five years, would suddenly become a ninny-headed dolt. I wish that Ms. Mallory had relied less on ghosts and a TSTL moment and more on her convincing characters and plot.</p>\n<p>On the whole, however, <b>The Guardian</b> is a well-written, entertaining historical romance. I look forward to the next story in the series, that of Alex, which is scheduled for publication this coming November. Alex, like Ian and the other returned Highlanders, is hugely engaging. I believe Ms. Mallory will have legions of new fans with this captivating new series.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Ian’s acute lust &#8211; compromised by his old anger &#8211; is balanced by Sileas’s struggles to fend him off until he truly wants her as his wife. Their sexual connection is strong and sweet and, when they do finally bed, it’s because they are ready to be truly wed, and are unmoored from their unhappy past. Ian’s and Sileas’s love story is set firmly into the larger story of the MacDonald clan and its political machinations. Alex, Connor, and Duncan, as well as many others in the clan, are substantial, fascinating characters. Ms. Mallory does a nice job of placing the clan’s story — which will continue in the other Return of the Highlanders books &#8211; in its context of early 16th century Scotland. As I read, I learned about a variety of weapons, a range of kinds of ale, the relationship between Scotland and France, unusual courtship rituals, Gaelic cultural customs, and more. I am always pleased when, in historical romance, the history is as rewarding as the romance. Such is the case in The Guardian. There were two things I didn’t like about this book. The first was the frequent appearance of the famed Scottish ghost, the Green Lady. She materializes at excessively useful times, at one point even stopping a rape. I don’t mind a little magic in my romance — in fact this story begins wonderfully with the four Highlander lads having their futures foretold by the local seer. In The Guardian, however, the Green Lady is used in ham-fisted ways and weakens the narrative. The second is an annoying occasion where Sileas, convinced that Ian doesn’t care for her, endangers the entire clan. It doesn’t make sense that Sileas, who cared faithfully for Ian’s family for five years, would suddenly become a ninny-headed dolt. I wish that Ms. Mallory had relied less on ghosts and a TSTL moment and more on her convincing characters and plot. On the whole, however, The Guardian is a well-written, entertaining historical romance. I look forward to the next story in the series, that of Alex, which is scheduled for publication this coming November. Alex, like Ian and the other returned Highlanders, is hugely engaging. I believe Ms. Mallory will have legions of new fans with this captivating new series. &nbsp;"

                "html": "<p>It is a truth universally acknowledged that a writer in possession of a good romance must be in want of a credible tale. Ms. Wildes, who references Jane Austen in her latest Regency romance, <b>One Whisper Away</b>, does not have one.     <a href=\"http://www.likesbooks.com/banmanpro/a.aspx?ZoneID=4&amp;Task=Click&amp;Mode=HTML&amp;SiteID=1&amp;PageID=98917\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">     <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http://www.likesbooks.com/banmanpro/a.aspx?ZoneID=4&amp;Task=Get&amp;Mode=HTML&amp;SiteID=1&amp;PageID=98917\" width=\"150\" height=\"200\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"></a> <!-- End - Site: Likesbooks.com Zone: Reviews Database --></p>\n<p>The story begins with a glass of spilled champagne and an unlikely whisper. Jonathan Bourne, the part-Iroquois Earl of Augustine, has recently come to England to take up his earldom and to marry off his three half-sisters. As the novel begins, he is somewhat inexplicably (he hates this sort of thing) at a ball. Also at the soirée is the stunning Lady Cecily Francis. A randomly gesticulating oaf spills a glass of bubbly on Cecily’s bosom. Jonathan wipes her breasts dry with his handkerchief, whispers to her that he’d rather lick it off, and then saunters away. None of this makes much sense. As written by Ms. Wildes, Jonathan is so ethical he lectures the bored ton matrons who sneak into his bed about the sanctity of marriage. He is an unlikely candidate for the aggressive overture Ms. Wildes saddles him with.</p>\n<p>Jonathan is an amalgam of archetypes: Soulful Native American, sexy seducer, stricken swain. He serves as a medium for the clear moral of this novel: It is more satisfying and morally superior <b><i>not</i></b> to follow the common edicts of the polite society. In <b>One Whisper Away</b>, Jonathan &#8211; and indeed every main character &#8211; behaves in a way that, were they to be caught and subject to social scrutiny, would result in them being banned from not just Almack’s Assembly Rooms but all aristocratic gatherings. I would have been less bothered by this rash display of behavior if the story gave these people a context that explained their actions. But the plot and setting of this novel is the over-explored Regency realm romance readers know well. As I read this book, I wondered why Ms. Wildes set it in the time period she did. Her characters behaved in decidedly modern ways and, placed as they are in early 1800’s England, their actions are implausible.</p>\n<p>It does make sense that Cecily would be drawn to Jonathan. Her peers call him Earl Savage because of his heritage and because he hails from that untamed land across the Atlantic. Cecily is instantly aroused by both the man and his wildness. And the reader doesn’t blame her. The poor woman is stuck in boorish British society while being courted by the nice but dull Lord Drury (one Elijah Winters) whom Cecily <b><i>really</i></b> does not want to marry. Not only is the man uninteresting, her vivacious and brilliant sister Eleanor — here again, inexplicably — wants the man for herself.</p>\n<p>In some ways, the two romances take the path one would expect. Cecily pursues Jonathan and pushes Elijah Eleanor’s way. Everyone involved learns not to judge Jonathan by the color of his skin. However, both courtships involve improbable not-so-secret trips to a lover’s bedroom and many a crazed risk. Jonathan and Cecily have an amazingly public sex life. They, before they are engaged, make love in her bedroom which, incredibly, her father is aware of. Once promised to one another, the two share aquatic afternoon delight in her family’s pond. The latter encounter leads, in an odd way, to a late in the book murder. That killing is part of a minor suspense schemata and is so removed from the rest of the plot I can only assume such machinations are now required in historical romance. Thrown into the mix is — I am not making this up—a small magic stone that somehow lets its owner know the inchoate wishes of the spirits.</p>\n<p>All of the sex, spirits, and shenanigans are written in the broadest of terms. Ms. Wildes uses six words or phrases where two would do. Her characters speak to one another in such stilted ways, it’s a wonder their relationships flourished. Jonathan proposes to Cecily by saying, “Become my wife in truth so we are not perpetrating a farce of an engagement on both our families, so neither of us is perjuring ourself to society — not that I care about that aspect of it for myself, but your reputation <b><i>does</i></b> matter to me — and for the sake of my sisters, I do not want to cause further whispers.” Amazingly, she promptly propositions him, proving that in this book, sex is more interesting than words.</p>\n<p>Did I care for anything about this book? Yes. The lead women in the book — Cecily, Eleanor, and Jonathan’s sister Lily — are lovely, interesting women. Lily, the heroine of the next book in this series, is a complex, winning figure who (for reasons easy to figure out) has opted for ruin rather than marriage. Eleanor and Cecily have a wonderful sister/friend relationship and I enjoyed watching them manage all the men in the book. Ms. Wildes is known for writing passionate love scenes and she does such well here. I particularly relished the confidence with which she asserts there was one sure way to “make sure a female found sexual satisfaction.” I foresee women everywhere leaving the book open to page 199 in the hopes that their partners will follow Jonathan’s lead.</p>\n<p>I like several of Ms. Wildes other books and did not find them to be as over-written and contextually disconcerting as <b>One Whisper Away</b>. I suspect that, in this book, Ms. Wildes is trying to teach readers about the dangers of bigotry and rigid propriety. The novel’s message is loud and clear: A culture that only values those who look and think like Regency aristocrats is an intolerant one. But I don’t read romances just for the lessons they teach. I also read for the pleasures of compelling, viable characters and context. In this one, only the heroines were compelling and the context was askew. Like spilled champagne, I found the experience of reading it to be a bit flat.</p>\n",

I would have been less bothered by this rash display of behavior if the story gave these people a context that explained their actions. But the plot and setting of this novel is the over-explored Regency realm romance readers know well. As I read this book, I wondered why Ms. Wildes set it in the time period she did. Her characters behaved in decidedly modern ways and, placed as they are in early 1800’s England, their actions are implausible. It does make sense that Cecily would be drawn to Jonathan. Her peers call him Earl Savage because of his heritage and because he hails from that untamed land across the Atlantic. Cecily is instantly aroused by both the man and his wildness. And the reader doesn’t blame her. The poor woman is stuck in boorish British society while being courted by the nice but dull Lord Drury (one Elijah Winters) whom Cecily really does not want to marry. Not only is the man uninteresting, her vivacious and brilliant sister Eleanor — here again, inexplicably — wants the man for herself. In some ways, the two romances take the path one would expect. Cecily pursues Jonathan and pushes Elijah Eleanor’s way. Everyone involved learns not to judge Jonathan by the color of his skin. However, both courtships involve improbable not-so-secret trips to a lover’s bedroom and many a crazed risk. Jonathan and Cecily have an amazingly public sex life. They, before they are engaged, make love in her bedroom which, incredibly, her father is aware of. Once promised to one another, the two share aquatic afternoon delight in her family’s pond. The latter encounter leads, in an odd way, to a late in the book murder. That killing is part of a minor suspense schemata and is so removed from the rest of the plot I can only assume such machinations are now required in historical romance. Thrown into the mix is — I am not making this up—a small magic stone that somehow lets its owner know the inchoate wishes of the spirits. All of the sex, spirits, and shenanigans are written in the broadest of terms. Ms. Wildes uses six words or phrases where two would do. Her characters speak to one another in such stilted ways, it’s a wonder their relationships flourished. Jonathan proposes to Cecily by saying, “Become my wife in truth so we are not perpetrating a farce of an engagement on both our families, so neither of us is perjuring ourself to society — not that I care about that aspect of it for myself, but your reputation does matter to me — and for the sake of my sisters, I do not want to cause further whispers.” Amazingly, she promptly propositions him, proving that in this book, sex is more interesting than words. Did I care for anything about this book? Yes. The lead women in the book — Cecily, Eleanor, and Jonathan’s sister Lily — are lovely, interesting women. Lily, the heroine of the next book in this series, is a complex, winning figure who (for reasons easy to figure out) has opted for ruin rather than marriage. Eleanor and Cecily have a wonderful sister/friend relationship and I enjoyed watching them manage all the men in the book. Ms. Wildes is known for writing passionate love scenes and she does such well here. I particularly relished the confidence with which she asserts there was one sure way to “make sure a female found sexual satisfaction.” I foresee women everywhere leaving the book open to page 199 in the hopes that their partners will follow Jonathan’s lead. I like several of Ms. Wildes other books and did not find them to be as over-written and contextually disconcerting as One Whisper Away. I suspect that, in this book, Ms. Wildes is trying to teach readers about the dangers of bigotry and rigid propriety. The novel’s message is loud and clear: A culture that only values those who look and think like Regency aristocrats is an intolerant one. But I don’t read romances just for the lessons they teach. I also read for the pleasures of compelling, viable characters and context. In this one, only the heroines were compelling and the context was askew. Like spilled champagne, I found the experience of reading it to be a bit flat."

                "html": "<p>This fourth and last of Madeline Hunter’s <b><i>Rarest Blooms</i></b> series, tells the tale of Tristan, the Duke of Castleford, and Daphne Joyes, the proprietor of The Rarest Blooms, an unusual nursery. Theirs is a grand romance. Tristan is a splendid character — a smart as hell duke who spends all his days drinking and whoring — all days, that is, but Tuesdays. Tristan’s sober, sex-free Tuesdays are the days he applies his intelligence and energy to whatever interests him: Managing his investments, advising the Prime Minister, meddling in the lives of his friends (something he did to great success in other <b><i>Rarest Blooms</i></b> books), or masterfully seducing the guarded and aloof Mrs. Joyes.</p>\n<p>Tristan’s closest cohorts are married to Daphne’s closest friends, yet the two have never actually met. (Tristan, once he sees how alluring she is, suspects his friends and their wives deliberately kept her out of his sight.) Their paths finally cross when Tristan inherits the land and the buildings that house The Rarest Blooms. Straight away, Tristan wants her in his bed and he is a master at getting what he wants. Daphne has heard countless scandalous stories about Tristan, and when he comes to introduce himself as her new landlord, she knows she’s in trouble. He makes it clear to her as they begin to negotiate the future of The Rarest Blooms, he will seduce her, pleasure her, and see her wearing nothing but diamonds. He is, of course, right.</p>\n<p>I so enjoyed this book. Ms. Hunter is a fine writer and in her capable hands, Daphne and Tristan are complex, fascinating characters. Tristan is a libertine whose life is the antithesis of domestic bliss and yet when he applies himself to the concerns of those around him, he enables them to find such bliss for themselves. Daphne offers sanctuary to fugitive women until those women are able to find love safely, yet has never thought such love is for her. She hides her heart and secrets — and she does have secrets &#8211; from everyone, even her friends, and is, beneath her placid chilliness, deeply lonely. As they banter, argue, and touch, Daphne and Tristan grow to be fundamentally changed. Tristan gives up his debauchery and Daphne, her secrets.</p>\n<p>Ms.Hunter writes so well that each choice her characters make seems exactly right. Their budding rapport is a delight to behold. In a series, the appearance of characters from other novels is sometimes at best distracting and at worst annoying; the opposite is true in <b>Dangerous in Diamonds</b>. Tristan’s interactions with his friends are wry and wonderfully illuminate not only Tristan but the lives the other men have chosen. Daphne and her companions from The Rarest Blooms have the kind of friendships that anchor lives and it’s poignant to see them support each other in ways large and small. As I read the last line of this book — which is wonderful &#8211; I was content. It’s not that this conclusive book is overly orderly, but rather that when the stories come to their end in <b>Dangerous in Diamonds</b>, it’s a satisfying finish.</p>\n<p>One of the interesting things about all four books is the subplot in each centers around the class wars taking place in England in the first half of the 19th century. Ms. Hunter’s heart is clearly on the side of the common man, for all that she writes tales of nobles, and she undergirds her books with a wealth of accurate history.

                "text": "This fourth and last of Madeline Hunter’s Rarest Blooms series, tells the tale of Tristan, the Duke of Castleford, and Daphne Joyes, the proprietor of The Rarest Blooms, an unusual nursery. Theirs is a grand romance. Tristan is a splendid character — a smart as hell duke who spends all his days drinking and whoring — all days, that is, but Tuesdays. Tristan’s sober, sex-free Tuesdays are the days he applies his intelligence and energy to whatever interests him: Managing his investments, advising the Prime Minister, meddling in the lives of his friends (something he did to great success in other Rarest Blooms books), or masterfully seducing the guarded and aloof Mrs. Joyes. Tristan’s closest cohorts are married to Daphne’s closest friends, yet the two have never actually met. (Tristan, once he sees how alluring she is, suspects his friends and their wives deliberately kept her out of his sight.) Their paths finally cross when Tristan inherits the land and the buildings that house The Rarest Blooms. Straight away, Tristan wants her in his bed and he is a master at getting what he wants. Daphne has heard countless scandalous stories about Tristan, and when he comes to introduce himself as her new landlord, she knows she’s in trouble. He makes it clear to her as they begin to negotiate the future of The Rarest Blooms, he will seduce her, pleasure her, and see her wearing nothing but diamonds. He is, of course, right. I so enjoyed this book. Ms. Hunter is a fine writer and in her capable hands, Daphne and Tristan are complex, fascinating characters. Tristan is a libertine whose life is the antithesis of domestic bliss and yet when he applies himself to the concerns of those around him, he enables them to find such bliss for themselves. Daphne offers sanctuary to fugitive women until those women are able to find love safely, yet has never thought such love is for her. She hides her heart and secrets — and she does have secrets &#8211; from everyone, even her friends, and is, beneath her placid chilliness, deeply lonely. As they banter, argue, and touch, Daphne and Tristan grow to be fundamentally changed. Tristan gives up his debauchery and Daphne, her secrets. Ms.Hunter writes so well that each choice her characters make seems exactly right. Their budding rapport is a delight to behold. In a series, the appearance of characters from other novels is sometimes at best distracting and at worst annoying; the opposite is true in Dangerous in Diamonds. Tristan’s interactions with his friends are wry and wonderfully illuminate not only Tristan but the lives the other men have chosen. Daphne and her companions from The Rarest Blooms have the kind of friendships that anchor lives and it’s poignant to see them support each other in ways large and small. As I read the last line of this book — which is wonderful &#8211; I was content. It’s not that this conclusive book is overly orderly, but rather that when the stories come to their end in Dangerous in Diamonds, it’s a satisfying finish. One of the interesting things about all four books is the subplot in each centers around the class wars taking place in England in the first half of the 19th century. Ms. Hunter’s heart is clearly on the side of the common man, for all that she writes tales of nobles, and she undergirds her books with a wealth of accurate history. In Dangerous in Diamonds, she puts Daphne and Tristan in the middle of the Manchester protests of 1819. In ways interesting and integral to the story, Ms. Hunter writes about the quest for wider suffrage, the harsh labor conditions British workers demanded Parliament change, and the deprivation the nation’s inequities in wealth created. Ms. Hunter also casts an informed and critical eye on England’s patriarchal legal system in which a woman had no worth or rights other than what the men in her life defined for her. Daphne, like each heroine in the series, has suffered at the hands of men.

Equally importantly, Daphne’s love allows Tristan to live a far richer life than the life he’s allowed himself. Theirs is a gem of a story. And speaking of gems, I do have one small quibble with this book: Its title. Not once is Daphne ever dangerous in the diamonds Tristan drapes her in. According to Tristan, she is delectable to love and exquisite to see. Perhaps Ms. Hunter didn’t want to liken Daphne to the fine wines Tristan plies her with.

The three are orphans and Sybilla must scheme daily — she’s busy nightly with a series of one-night stands — to hold onto the family stronghold. Alys and Sybilla routinely clash and, on the night we meet the monkey, Alys shames the family by insulting the monkey’s owner, a vile woman named Lady Bloodshire.

Not only is he trying to recover from a murderous beating at the hands of his dastardly stepmother and stepbrother, he’s suddenly saddled with Alys who announces she’s his wife and then dogs his heels as he, limping, in pain, and now infected by simian bacteria, heads to London to assert his heritage.</p>\n<p>Piers is too good for Alys.

                "html": "<p>Pamela Clare&#8217;s latest <b><i>I Team</i></b> book is a fine addition to an exciting series. Ms. Clare’s I-Team is a group of investigative journalists who work for the fictional <i>Denver Independent</i>. The women of the team, all reporters, have in previous books taken on pernicious social evils, while falling in love (and lust) with smart, sexy heroes. Ms. Clare, a journalist herself, knows how to write a gripping story and <b>Breaking Point</b> is her most compelling romantic suspense novel thus far.</p>\n<p>She dedicates her tale to &#8220;the memory of the hundreds of murdered and missing women of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico&#8230;. (who) were brutalized and discarded.&#8221; Ms. Clare&#8217;s passion for justice for Las Muertas de Juarez &#8211; it&#8217;s estimated that as few as 400 and as many as 5000 women have disappeared from that border town in the past two decades &#8211; makes this book not only an absorbing read but a stirring call for justice for the women and the brave reporters who have been killed while working in Mexico. That nation, as Ms. Clare points out, is now the most dangerous place in the world &#8211; outside of an outright war zone &#8211; to be a journalist.</p>\n<p>The I-Team reporter in this book, Natalie Benoit, has come to Juarez for a three-day professional conference. Natalie lost her fiancé and parents in Katrina and is still tormented by that storm’s aftermath. She signed up for the conference hoping it would push her past the emptiness she constantly feels. As she and the other conferees are headed to an event, their bus is highjacked by a group of stone-cold killers who shoot all the Latino journalists and kidnap Natalie. They cuff her, heave her into the trunk of a car, take her to an abandoned church in the remote countryside, and imprison her in a cell. In the chamber next to her, chained to the wall, is Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal Zach McBride.</p>\n<p>Zach and Natalie are being held by Los Zetas, a powerful Mexican crime ring ostensibly run by Arturo César Cárdenas (whom Zach was attempting to take down). Zach was betrayed by a colleague &#8211; a Mexican Interpol agent &#8211; and now Los Zetas, who don&#8217;t know he is a U.S. agent, believe he has stolen a large shipment of cocaine from them. When Natalie arrives, Zach is hanging on to sanity by a slight thread. Los Zetas have beaten him badly, broken his ribs, and spent the better part of a week torturing him by depriving him of food, water, and sleep. Most horrifically, they have been using electrical cables and a truck battery to try and make him talk. As Los Zetas throw Natalie into the cell, Zach hears the men say Natalie is here for Cardenas. (Natalie&#8217;s Spanish is poor and she can&#8217;t understand what the men are saying.) Zach knows Cardenas is a death sentence for Natalie; he’s known for brutally sexually abusing women, then sacrificing them to <i>La Santa Muerte</i>, the grisly sect saint of many of Mexico&#8217;s narcotrafficers. Zach and Natalie begin to talk through their cell walls. Listening to Natalie keeps Zach&#8217;s pain at bay and, Natalie, terrified and sure she&#8217;s going to die, talks openly about the horror of her time in New Orleans. They verbally bond, give each other courage and, in a nail-biter of a scene, manage to escape Los Zetas. They travel through the lethal Mexican desert, trying to get to the border, while the vicious Los Zetas are hot on their trail.</p>\n<p>Ms. Clare&#8217;s story is a complex one.

                "text": "Pamela Clare&#8217;s latest I Team book is a fine addition to an exciting series. Ms. Clare’s I-Team is a group of investigative journalists who work for the fictional Denver Independent. The women of the team, all reporters, have in previous books taken on pernicious social evils, while falling in love (and lust) with smart, sexy heroes. Ms. Clare, a journalist herself, knows how to write a gripping story and Breaking Point is her most compelling romantic suspense novel thus far. She dedicates her tale to &#8220;the memory of the hundreds of murdered and missing women of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico&#8230;. (who) were brutalized and discarded.&#8221; Ms. Clare&#8217;s passion for justice for Las Muertas de Juarez &#8211; it&#8217;s estimated that as few as 400 and as many as 5000 women have disappeared from that border town in the past two decades &#8211; makes this book not only an absorbing read but a stirring call for justice for the women and the brave reporters who have been killed while working in Mexico. That nation, as Ms. Clare points out, is now the most dangerous place in the world &#8211; outside of an outright war zone &#8211; to be a journalist. The I-Team reporter in this book, Natalie Benoit, has come to Juarez for a three-day professional conference. Natalie lost her fiancé and parents in Katrina and is still tormented by that storm’s aftermath. She signed up for the conference hoping it would push her past the emptiness she constantly feels. As she and the other conferees are headed to an event, their bus is highjacked by a group of stone-cold killers who shoot all the Latino journalists and kidnap Natalie. They cuff her, heave her into the trunk of a car, take her to an abandoned church in the remote countryside, and imprison her in a cell. In the chamber next to her, chained to the wall, is Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal Zach McBride. Zach and Natalie are being held by Los Zetas, a powerful Mexican crime ring ostensibly run by Arturo César Cárdenas (whom Zach was attempting to take down). Zach was betrayed by a colleague &#8211; a Mexican Interpol agent &#8211; and now Los Zetas, who don&#8217;t know he is a U.S. agent, believe he has stolen a large shipment of cocaine from them. When Natalie arrives, Zach is hanging on to sanity by a slight thread. Los Zetas have beaten him badly, broken his ribs, and spent the better part of a week torturing him by depriving him of food, water, and sleep. Most horrifically, they have been using electrical cables and a truck battery to try and make him talk. As Los Zetas throw Natalie into the cell, Zach hears the men say Natalie is here for Cardenas. (Natalie&#8217;s Spanish is poor and she can&#8217;t understand what the men are saying.) Zach knows Cardenas is a death sentence for Natalie; he’s known for brutally sexually abusing women, then sacrificing them to La Santa Muerte, the grisly sect saint of many of Mexico&#8217;s narcotrafficers. Zach and Natalie begin to talk through their cell walls. Listening to Natalie keeps Zach&#8217;s pain at bay and, Natalie, terrified and sure she&#8217;s going to die, talks openly about the horror of her time in New Orleans. They verbally bond, give each other courage and, in a nail-biter of a scene, manage to escape Los Zetas. They travel through the lethal Mexican desert, trying to get to the border, while the vicious Los Zetas are hot on their trail. Ms. Clare&#8217;s story is a complex one. Los Zetas are after Natalie for reasons that, on the surface, have nothing to do with the brutal drug trade. The thugs seeking Zach want their millions of dollars of missing cocaine and, once they realize he&#8217;s on the run with Natalie, they bring in the power behind Los Zetas, a man of unlimited political and financial resources. In this book, like the other books in the series, the greatest criminals are those with money and power. These men will stop at nothing to recapture Natalie and Zach. The suspense in the novel is thrilling and doesn&#8217;t relent until the end of the tale. The romance in this book is equally intriguing. Zach and Natalie each have had heartbreaking losses in their pasts. Zach, a former SEAL who suffers from PTSD from his time serving in Afghanistan, doesn&#8217;t believe he has the capacity to love or be loved. Natalie lost everything and everyone she loved in New Orleans and is afraid to open herself up again to the risk that comes with caring. As they make their way back to the U.S., they must trust and rely on one another. The two, who are trying to escape death, find solace in sex and their passion for each other is intense and primal. As Natalie and Zach journey through Mexico toward the U.S. border, other members of the I-Team and their spouses work to help the two make it home safely. One of the delights of this book — for those who have followed the series — is its inclusion of past heroes and heroines. Ms. Clare skillfully integrates these other characters into her story and their presence strengthens an already strong book. I began reading this book on a gorgeous Sunday morning and didn&#8217;t put it down until dusk when I turned the last page.

And while the man in the story, Connor Malone, is overtly described as white, his lover, Lyric Jones, is never ascribed a skin color. The only reason I thought about this as I read the book is that, in a lovely way, it doesn’t matter to the story.

This book, for an erotic romance, is pretty tame. Connor and Lyric don’t make love until the book’s almost half done. And when they do, it’s in mainstream ways — no ménages, alternate entries, or fancy contraptions. This mainstream vibe is definitely, in the beginning, coming from Connor. Lyric, badly damaged by an abusive childhood, is a wild child. Yet her unconventional sex life has been about avoidance rather than connection, and from the moment she meets Connor she abandons her wilder ways.

Connor, an ex-military hunk who now works for his family’s security firm, grudgingly agrees to watch over Lyric as a favor for a friend of his father’s. Lyric is a pop star diva whose exploits fill the tabloids. She loves no one, trusts no one, and <b><i>never ever</i></b> wants to be alone with anyone. The idea of intimacy makes her skin crawl.

                "html": "<p>Eden Gillman, one of the protagonists in Suzanne Brockmann’s 16th <b><i>Troubleshooters</i></b> novel, has had an exceptionally inopportune life. She’s been gang-raped, drugged, groped by every boss she’s ever had, sexually molested by her brother-in-law, assaulted by her step-father, slandered by the creep who took her virginity, abused by loser boyfriends, and repeatedly called a whore by her family. She almost drowned in Hurricane Katrina, was later menaced by crazed criminals, miscarried her baby, and suffered a crippling depression. And she’s just 19.</p>\n<p>Amazingly, in <b>Breaking the Rules</b>, Eden’s not the character who has suffered the most. That would be Neesha, a young Indonesian girl sold into sexual slavery at age eight and then regularly raped and beaten for the next eight years. Neesha, who escaped her vile captors and is now on the run in Las Vegas, is connected to Eden through Eden’s younger brother Ben, an appealing 15 year old gay kid. Ben has been mistreated by his parents, shipped off to a horrific “Scare the Queers Straight” facility, mocked by his peers, and has life threatening diabetes. Ben meets the terrified Neesha while she’s hiding out at the mall, trying not to be recaptured by the international sex slavers. That meeting brings Ben and Eden — as well as Eden’s husband Izzy Zanella, her brother Dan, and his saintly girlfriend Jennilyn LaMay — to the attention of the uber-evil slaver thugs who will kill anyone who gets in their way.</p>\n<p>I will offend Suzanne Brockmann fans worldwide, but I’m just going to say it: This is a weak novel. Its plot is meandering; its gloom, almost unceasing; the writing, inconsistent; and its lovers, limited by their snottiness — St. Jenni notwithstanding. I haven’t read all the books in the series so Eden, Izzy, Dan, and Jenni aren’t characters I am invested in. But, even if I had read all the <b><i>Troubleshooters</i></b> books, I still would have found this story wanting.</p>\n<p>I did read the first five <b><i>Troubleshooters</i></b> books and thought they were good. I loved the interplay between the past and the present, the sense that women could be as heroic as men, and the implied belief that people are defined by what they do rather than the sort of people they love. Ms. Brockmann’s characters were emotionally mature and, in all the best ways, worked to earn the love they deserved. In contrast to those earlier novels, <b>Breaking the Rules</b> is primarily peopled by characters both immature and self-indulgent.</p>\n<p>Eden is a bratty Madonna/whore whose best characteristic — besides an enviable ability to have mind-blowing sex in rental cars — is how much she loves her younger brother, Ben. Izzy, who actually becomes <b><i>less</i></b> mature as the novel progresses, may be good at saving others, but he’s too terrified of getting dumped by Eden to stretch himself as a man. Dan, who manages to get critically shot not once but twice in this book, is a jerk: Rude to his sister, dismissive of Izzy’s overtures of friendship, and overly inclined to use sex to get his way. His love for Jenni does not redeem him. Who wouldn’t love Jenni? She’s rather like Mary Poppins: practically perfect in every way. (Actually, maybe Ms. Brockmann doesn’t love Jenni. She constantly stresses how ordinary Jenni’s looks are compared to Dan’s and Eden’s and implies that, somehow, wonderful Jenni is lucky to have caught asshat Dan.) The most likable, credible character in the book is Ben and even his story comes with a caveat.</p>\n<p>Ms. Brockmann is, admirably, at the forefront of the LGBT rights movement and her outrage at how the world treats its — to steal a phrase from Lady Gaga — “little monsters” is palpable. But, too often this book becomes a pulpit rather than a novel and, ironically, that weakens its plea. Ben is a lovely guy and, were I to read another <b><i>Troubleshooters</i></b> novel, the character from this book I’d most like to revisit would be Ben. I wish that Ms. Brockmann had trusted the strength of the wonderful character she created — Ben — rather than filling her book with stentorian rhetoric.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this book is implausibly bleak. Almost every single character encounters or has encountered over-the-top tragedy. (A couple from earlier books shows up briefly, happily wed and then, for no apparent reason, misfortune befalls even them.) Many of calamities are extreme. The bad guys chasing Neesha aren’t just sex slavers; they’re involved in snuff films/fantasies as well. The non Eden/Dan Gillmans aren’t just nasty — they’re sick in ways that transcend ordinarily terrible families. The practices of the “camp” Ben’s parents send him to aren’t just wrong-headed, they’re depraved. Taken individually, these malevolent events would have been compelling. Relentlessly combined, they’re unbelievable.</p>\n<p>The best thing about this book is that it’s funny. The gallows humor in this novel rescues many a scene from utter misfortune. Perhaps my favorite line in the book is one that describes a woman’s beehive wig as “if they’d caught her on the way to an audition for a B-52’s tribute band.” It’s really amusing that the sex slavers are also running a thriving business killing bedbugs.

The possible bad news is it’s so similar in plot to the first book in the series, <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/simply-irresistible/\"><b>Simply Irresistible</b></a>, I felt swamped by déjà vu as I raced through the pages.</p>\n<p>Ms. Gibson writes well about love that makes you laugh and love that makes you cry. Both books have moving storylines and characters easy to care for. It’s just a bit of a bummer that the stories are so akin to one another. Maybe it shouldn’t be. Great artists like Monet and Van Gough painted different versions of the same things over and over again and we consider each painting a masterpiece despite the sameness of subject. Perhaps we should just be pleased that Ms. Gibson has brought her formidable writing skills back to the story of two people who share a child but not, initially, a life.</p>\n<p>In <b>Any Man of Mine</b>, the parents are Autumn Haven and Chinook defensive player Sam LeClaire. Autumn and Sam first met in Vegas five years ago. As Sam recalls it, “he’d met a redheaded girl in a bar and married her a few days later, and the next morning he’d left her behind at Caesars like a used bath towel.” Autumn remembers it a bit differently: “She’d married Sam after knowing him a total of five days because she’d fallen madly, desperately, in love with him.” They marry, full of booze and crazy feelings, and, on their wedding night, make love without a condom. When Autumn wakes the next morning, Sam is gone. One week later, she receives a letter from his lawyer demanding a divorce. Autumn, broken hearted and alone, realizes she’s pregnant by a guy who doesn’t give a damn about her. She has the baby on her own but once their son Conner is born, she contacts Sam and tells him he’s a dad. Sam, from the first moment he holds Conner, loves his son and accepts full financial responsibility for him. But that’s about it.</p>\n<p>Sam’s a shallow guy and that’s how he likes it. He enjoys his life and has attained every goal he’s set for himself. He’s got a great apartment, a string of gorgeous women in his bed, tons of money, and a high-paying job he loves. Sam’s aware he’s not much of a dad, but he’s never thought it mattered much. The way he sees it, he ponies up money to Autumn, she raises his kid, and Sam gets to live the easy life. Autumn puts up with Sam’s happy-go-lucky behavior because she believes “Conner needed a father, no matter how crappy.”</p>\n<p>I loved the story of Sam, Autumn, and Conner. Sam is a jerk in the beginning of the book, albeit a jerk with more charm than any man should ever have. There’s a great scene in the second chapter when Autumn and Sam are in the same place for the first time in almost two years. (The last time they were in the same room they fought so bitterly they decided to avoid any contact. Conner’s been passed back and forth between them by a series of babysitters.) Autumn is an event planner and she’s worked hard to make her business succeed. She’s running the wedding of Faith Duffy and Ty Savage (the lovers from <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/true-love-and-other-disasters/\"><b>True Love and Other Disasters</b></a>) and Sam is one of the guests. As Sam is trying to have a civil conversation with Autumn, her phone rings and her brother, who is watching Conner, tells her he’s been called into work. Autumn begins to run through all the options she has for childcare for Conner and not once does she think of Sam. It’s one of many scenes where Ms. Gibson <b><i>shows</i></b> the reader how characters feel. Sam, because it’s no trouble for him, offers to have his assistant pick up Conner and take him back to Sam’s place where he — Conner — has a bedroom. Autumn reluctantly says yes because Sam is the only choice she has.</p>\n<p>The next day, when Sam brings Conner home — he isn’t even sure exactly where Conner and Autumn live — he’s an hour and a half later than he told Autumn he would be and she blows up at him. Ms. Gibson’s prose makes Sam and Autumn vibrantly real:</p>\n<blockquote><p>”You’re immature and irresponsible.” “Well, sweetheart, I never said I wasn’t irresponsible. But you’re too controlling.” “He’s my son.” “He’s my son too.” “He’s your son when it’s convenient for you.” “Well, it was convenient today. Get over it.” “Get over it? Get OVER it?”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Autumn tells Sam that Conner “doesn’t know you’re just a selfish prick unworthy of him, but he’ll figure it out someday.” Sam realizes that she’s right and that while “He wasn’t as bad as dad as Autumn portrayed him, he wasn’t as good as he needed to be either. All that had to change. He had to do the right thing.”</p>\n<p>Watching Sam learn to do the right thing is wonderful. It doesn’t happen quickly and Autumn doesn’t make it easy but Sam keeps at it and slowly he and Autumn redefine their relationship. As Sam spends time with Conner, Sam and Autumn, for the first time in five years, spend time with each other and are forced to change how they see each other and themselves. In fits and starts, they transform from being at odds and sharing a child to parents who wonder if they could be a family. Ms. Gibson weaves pieces about their past in beautifully and, late in the book, when Sam muses “maybe his heart had really shitty timing,” the reader knows it to be true.</p>\n<p>I really like this novel. Ms. Gibson writes well about men — Sam and his buddies, many of whom are featured in other <b><i>Chinook</i></b> books, are authentic guys rather than just cardboard hotties. Autumn is a believable woman as well. She’s a working mom with a great sense of humor and Ms. Gibson makes Autumn’s love for the men in her life poignantly palpable. Ms. Gibson writes deftly about her characters and all the ways they interact. The love scenes are sexy and moving and, best of all, true to wherever Sam and Autumn are in their relationship. As they change, the love they make changes and it’s dazzling to see. With the exception of a few overly sappy speeches at the end, I didn’t have a quibble with a word in this book. (Although I didn’t like the fact that Ms. Gibson creates a mystery surrounding Autumn’s brother that she doesn’t in any way resolve. I can only assume that plot line will be revealed in another book.)</p>\n<p>To me, ultimately, it doesn’t matter there are so many parallels to Ms. Gibson’s earlier novel. (And there are <b><i>so</i></b> many, big and small.) Autumn, Sam, and Conner (just like John, Georgeanne, and Lexie from <b>Simply Irresistible</b>) are appealing and their tale is winningly told. <b>Any Man of Mind</b> tells a stellar story and, when I finished it, I went to my bookshelves, pulled out <b>Simply Irresistible</b> and began to read it again…for the fourth time.</p>\n<p><strong>Buy it at <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2FiV5XD\">Amazon</a>/<a href=\"https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/book/any-man-of-mine/id412378484?mt=11&amp;at=1010lmPQ\">iBooks</a>/<a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8039827/type/dlg/https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/any-man-of-mine-rachel-gibson/1100479597?ean=9780062079169\">Barnes and Noble</a>/<a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=b95pXvP*dp4&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=551651.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=9310&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Febook%2Fany-man-of-mine-1\">Kobo</a></strong></p>\n",

Marcus, the CIA, the Kellys, and the brother of the man Marcus killed are all chasing after Sarah and Garrett, as well as each other.

Regin and Aiden met centuries ago and are destined to lose and love each other over and over. Regin is an immortal and Aidan is striving for immortality but not quite there. They are cursed to, every time they meet (in whatever incarnation Aiden is in this era), kiss and then have Aiden die. Regin has learned the hard way that loving Aiden means his death and thus has devoted most of her energies over the past few decades to the violent, entertaining, video-game playing life she shares with her immortal sisters at the wryly named Val Hall in New Orleans.</p>\n<p>Regin has been hilariously featured in many of the other <b><i>IAD</i></b> books and, as this tale begins, she is heading off to go help her sister Lucia, whose adventures are featured in the seventh book, <b>Pleasure of a Dark Prince</b>. However, before she can leave, she is captured by Aiden, who in his current incarnation is a bitter, cruel Irishman named Declan Chase. Declan works for the Order, a creepy organization determined to wipe all immortals — good or evil — off the face of the planet. Declan is a twisted piece of work. His first encounter with immortals involved a bunch of horrific beings killing his family and torturing him. Since then he has been driven to do the same to any immortal unlucky enough to fall into his and the Order’s hands. He has no memory of his earlier lives and, now that he’s ensnared Regin, he plans to torture, then brutally kill her in the Order’s secret prison complex.</p>\n<p>Regin, from the moment she’s in his presence, realizes that Declan is the latest version of Aiden. She’s got a host of choices, none of them pleasant, to consider now that Aiden/Declan is back in her life. She knows he’s her true love, she knows he has no idea what they are to one another and, most importantly given that he has trapped and is torturing her peers and friends, she knows if she can get him to kiss her the kiss will ensure his rapid demise. Her problems are complicated by the fact that she has a hard time seeing her beloved Aiden in harsh Declan. He’s a hottie but he’s not the hottie she’s used to and that makes her path even less clear.</p>\n<p>Ms. Cole’s world is filled with amusing, extraordinary characters and many of them show up in <b>Dreams of a Dark Warrior</b>. Whacko Nix and sketchy Lothaire play a large part in this book and it’s easy to see (and hope) that theirs may be the next installment in the series. The <b><i>IAD</i></b> books are known for being incendiary and this book, while less burning than others in the series, is replete with both excellent sexual tension and sex.

OK, so our hero isn’t <b><i>actually</i></b> Gregory House. He’s Piers Yelverton, the Earl of Marchant, and he practices his snarky, deductive medicine in a huge castle in Wales, but he’s essentially House complete with cane, problematic familial relationships, debilitating pain, and a very nasty tongue. Piers, like House, is a Beast.</p>\n<p>The caustic Piers lives a life of self-imposed exile in his castle turned hospital in Wales. He was severely injured when young and suffers from chronic pain in his leg. He practices brilliant medicine on the locals — he is superb at diagnosing and treating their maladies. (He is not a surgeon — the cutting is done by his handsome French cousin Sebastien with whom Piers works.) Piers avoids anything resembling affection from others and has absolutely no plans to ever marry and produce an heir. In fact, all who know him believe his childhood accident left him impotent.</p>\n<p>Our heroine, the beauteous Linnet Berry Thrynne, needs a hasty marriage. All of London, including her father, believe that due to a few kisses with a prince and a dress that made her look enceinte, she’s probably pregnant and definitely disgraced. Linnet’s father — desperate for a groom — and Piers’ father — desperate for an heir — devise the perfect solution: Linnet will marry Piers, call the prince’s child his, and give the Marchant family a legal, blue-blooded heir. Linnet, despite knowing perfectly well the prince did no more than kiss her, agrees to this scheme because her father is insistent, no one in London will speak to her and, well, she rather likes the idea of marriage to an impotent man — she found the whole kissing thing with the prince quite distasteful. So, off the Wales she heads, the Beauty heading into the lair of the Beast.</p>\n<p>Ms. James does a nice job with her fairy tale. Linnet is as intelligent as she is gorgeous and she’s more than capable of standing up to Piers and his almost intolerable rudeness. The two learn to like and love one another and their interactions are witty and passionate (although it takes Linnet longer than it should to realize Piers’ impotency is the stuff of legend). They are surrounded by fabulous secondary characters — I loved Piers’ divorced parents and the marvelously named butler Prufrock. Best of all is the setting — Piers’ castle is a bona fide hospital full of interesting patients and staff and genuinely engrossing medical dilemmas. The last quarter of the book is a moving medical tragedy — an epidemic of scarlet fever strikes the area and Piers and his staff struggle to save as many lives as they can. Piers is an appealing hero — smart, entertaining, very sexy and, underneath all his barbs, a genuinely good man.</p>\n<p>I enjoyed this book, but it was still a bit of a disappointment. When Ms. James is on as a writer, she writes with grace and insight. To me, her fairy tale series (the first is <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/a-kiss-at-midnight-2/\"><b>A Kiss at Midnight</b></a>) doesn’t have the depth found in the best of her other romances. I liked Linnet but I didn’t find her memorable. (I felt the same way about Kate in <b>A Kiss at Midnight</b>.) Piers’ reluctance to commit to Linnet irked me; I didn’t believe the damage from his childhood had the power to keep him from grasping the joy he finds with her. When he sends her away, despite her avowal of love, I wanted to smack him. Frankly I found Robert and Marguerite (Piers’ parents) the more affecting couple.</p>\n<p>However, these are quibbles. <b>When Beauty Tamed the Beast</b> is an interesting and satisfying read. By the end of the novel, Piers and Linnet have survived tragedy with grace. Their story is moving and often wickedly funny. Piers, unlike his TV doppelganger, gets the happily ever after he deserves. I am sure — and remember it is a fairy tale — Piers and Linnet will have long and loving lives healing and helping the people of Wales and will never once be sued for malpractice. The cranky Dr. House might call this tale implausible nonsense but I call it well-done romantic fiction.</p>\n",

                "html": "<p>I had to wait a few hours after I finished this book to write this review — it’s hard to type when fanning oneself. This book is smoking hot — the sexual tension between the two leads crackles on the page and their love scenes are remarkably passionate. The hero, Lord Thomas Armstrong, is absurdly sure of himself, extraordinarily sexually talented, and gorgeous. The heroine, Lady Amelia Bertram, is sharp-tongued, headstrong, and, of course, beautiful. Their story, a loose retelling of <b>The Taming of the Shrew</b>, is both predictable and entertaining.</p>\n<p>Amelia, at 19, has caused no end of problems for her widowed father. She has twice tried to run off with unsuitable suitors, is routinely shockingly rude, and refuses to marry any of the gentlemen who court her. Frankly, she’s often a brat. She is particularly discourteous to the handsome Viscount Armstrong, whom her father has mentored for several years — Thomas’s father died when he was just out of Eton. Amelia resents Thomas Armstrong’s closeness with her father, for she feels her father has woefully neglected her since her mother’s death when Amelia was thirteen. For his part, Thomas finds Amelia to be a “disrespectful termagant.” The first time they were introduced — a year prior to this novel — she insulted him at a ball by calling him “at best a rake about town, and, at worst a debaucher of women and maiden sensibilities.” If she’d been a man, he’d have thrashed her. Instead, he has since avoided her.</p>\n<p>Harry, Amelia’s father, knows the two dislike one another; nonetheless he asks if Thomas will take Amelia into his (chaperoned) care while Harry spends several months in America completing business for the shipping company the two are part-owners of. Thomas flatly refuses&#8230;until later that week, when Amelia again humiliates him at a ball by saying, very loudly, she’d bet her dowry his reputation as a great lover is wildly overrated. Thomas, now out for revenge, agrees to take Amelia into his care where his word will be her law for the next four months. The two of them travel to his country estate where their sexy battle of the sexes begins.</p>\n<p>The best part about this book is the humor and sexual tension between Amelia and Thomas. Neither of them is especially likable but they are interesting and clever. Thomas is an ultra alpha-male, but he is never cruel or mean as he battles Amelia for control of their changing relationship. They banter very well. They fall in lust long before they fall in love — both guard their hearts carefully due to their pasts — and their frequent physical encounters are satisfyingly steamy. (If you are annoyed by the “virgin jumps into bed with the hot hero despite the mores of the times” plotline, this book is not for you.) But witty repartee and hot sex alone do not a great book make, and, in the latter third of the book, both Thomas and Amelia make unbelievable choices that are irritatingly self-destructive. The penultimate conflict that drives them apart is silly and their reconciliation then rushed.</p>\n<p><b>A Taste of Desire</b> is second in a series Ms. Kendall calls <b><i>The Elusive Lords</i></b>. The lords of the series are three friends: Thomas, James and Alex. I read the first book, <b>Sinful Surrender</b> &#8211; the story of James and Thomas’s sister Missy — and will, I’m sure, read Alex’s tale as well. For despite the plot weaknesses in Ms. Kendall’s first two books, they are sizzling, enjoyable reads. I can definitely recommend <b>A Taste of Desire</b> &#8211; for, ahem, fans of sensual romance.</p>\n",

The heroine, Lady Amelia Bertram, is sharp-tongued, headstrong, and, of course, beautiful. Their story, a loose retelling of The Taming of the Shrew, is both predictable and entertaining. Amelia, at 19, has caused no end of problems for her widowed father. She has twice tried to run off with unsuitable suitors, is routinely shockingly rude, and refuses to marry any of the gentlemen who court her. Frankly, she’s often a brat. She is particularly discourteous to the handsome Viscount Armstrong, whom her father has mentored for several years — Thomas’s father died when he was just out of Eton. Amelia resents Thomas Armstrong’s closeness with her father, for she feels her father has woefully neglected her since her mother’s death when Amelia was thirteen. For his part, Thomas finds Amelia to be a “disrespectful termagant.” The first time they were introduced — a year prior to this novel — she insulted him at a ball by calling him “at best a rake about town, and, at worst a debaucher of women and maiden sensibilities.” If she’d been a man, he’d have thrashed her. Instead, he has since avoided her. Harry, Amelia’s father, knows the two dislike one another; nonetheless he asks if Thomas will take Amelia into his (chaperoned) care while Harry spends several months in America completing business for the shipping company the two are part-owners of. Thomas flatly refuses&#8230;until later that week, when Amelia again humiliates him at a ball by saying, very loudly, she’d bet her dowry his reputation as a great lover is wildly overrated. Thomas, now out for revenge, agrees to take Amelia into his care where his word will be her law for the next four months. The two of them travel to his country estate where their sexy battle of the sexes begins. The best part about this book is the humor and sexual tension between Amelia and Thomas. Neither of them is especially likable but they are interesting and clever. Thomas is an ultra alpha-male, but he is never cruel or mean as he battles Amelia for control of their changing relationship. They banter very well. They fall in lust long before they fall in love — both guard their hearts carefully due to their pasts — and their frequent physical encounters are satisfyingly steamy. (If you are annoyed by the “virgin jumps into bed with the hot hero despite the mores of the times” plotline, this book is not for you.) But witty repartee and hot sex alone do not a great book make, and, in the latter third of the book, both Thomas and Amelia make unbelievable choices that are irritatingly self-destructive. The penultimate conflict that drives them apart is silly and their reconciliation then rushed. A Taste of Desire is second in a series Ms. Kendall calls The Elusive Lords. The lords of the series are three friends: Thomas, James and Alex. I read the first book, Sinful Surrender &#8211; the story of James and Thomas’s sister Missy — and will, I’m sure, read Alex’s tale as well. For despite the plot weaknesses in Ms. Kendall’s first two books, they are sizzling, enjoyable reads. I can definitely recommend A Taste of Desire &#8211; for, ahem, fans of sensual romance."

                "html": "<p><b>How to Woo at Reluctant Lady</b> is the third book in Sabrina Jeffries’ <i><b>Hellions of Halstead Hall</b></i> series and it does not function well as a stand-alone book. That is fine with me because I have read the first two books in the series, but if you haven’t, don’t start here. There are five Sharpe siblings, each of whom will have their own book. The Sharpes are orphans being raised by their middle-class grandmother after their parents, Lord and Lady Stoneville, were shot and killed when the children were small. The cause of those deaths is a mystery whose plot line runs through the series in a way that demands a reader begin with book one, <a href=\"https://allaboutromance.com/book-review/the-truth-about-lord-stoneville/\"><b>The Truth about Lord Stoneville</b></a>, and then read the others in subsequent sibling order.</p>\n<p><b>How to Woo a Reluctant Lady</b> is the best of the series so far in large part because it tells the story of one of the Sharpe sisters — Minerva — a more unusual a protagonist than either of her older brothers. Minerva is a successful writer of gothic novels, and one of the joys of this book is seeing the world through her writer’s gaze. Minerva is smart, droll, and insightful and it’s fun to watch her take her world and turn it into the stuff of novels. And while she is, of course, beautiful and blessed with a “lushly feminine” form, our hero Giles Masterson admires her intelligence and wit as much as he desires her in his bed.</p>\n<p>Giles, whom long-term Ms. Jeffries fans will remember from <b>Wed Him before You Bed Him</b> (he is the younger brother of that book’s hero), is many things at thirty-four. He is a successful barrister, a spy for the Crown, a known rogue, and Minerva’s childhood love. Unfortunately for Giles, ten years ago he kissed and then dissed nineteen-year-old Minerva and she’s been skewering him in her books ever since by making him over into the fictional villainous French (!) spy Rockton. One of the great jokes in the book is everyone in Minerva’s life sees themselves in her characters — her brother Oliver, Lord STONEville, is convinced that he is ROCKton. But Giles recognizes details about his character that no one other than he and Minerva would know — their first kiss was part of Minerva’s first book — and he knows that Minerva is writing about him. This poses a serious problem for him because on the night of that first kiss — the real one —Minerva saw him stealing documents from a peer and, were Minerva to put <b><i>that</i></b> scene in her books, Giles worries his role as a secret spy for the Crown might be discovered.</p>\n<p>So, when Minerva has to marry within a year — a condition the Sharpes’ grandmother has forced on all five of her grandchildren because they are all behaving like <b><i>hellions</i></b> — Giles asks for her hand in exchange for her ceasing her fictional depictions of him. Minerva, who believes her grandmother will never let her actually marry such a rake, says yes. And while Minerva thinks the courtship is a sham, Giles does not. He is strongly drawn to Minerva, physically and mentally, and he sets about wooing his reluctant lady with great skill and charm.</p>\n<p>I have very few quibbles with this book. There are too many scenes involving her older brothers who have gone from dreadfully wanton rakes to stuffy married men obsessed with their sister’s propriety. The mystery isn’t very interesting and it takes too long for Giles to tell Minerva his big secret. But, the small flaws in this book are outweighed by its pleasures. When she’s writing well, Ms. Jeffries writes really well. One of the best scenes in the book occurs when Giles, trying to show Minerva that he really is a damn good catch, has her spend a day watching him practice law in the famed Old Bailey. Ms. Jeffries gives us a detailed glimpse of that court, full of interesting and anachronistic details. The love scenes between Minerva and Giles are sexy and varied without being overblown. And the love that grows between the couple is nice to see — Giles and Minerva each becomes the other’s biggest fan and together they create a lovely, very equal relationship.</p>\n<p>At the end of the novel, three of the five Hellions have been tamed. Here’s hoping the stories of the last two, Gabriel and Celia, are as well done as Minerva’s.</p>\n",
